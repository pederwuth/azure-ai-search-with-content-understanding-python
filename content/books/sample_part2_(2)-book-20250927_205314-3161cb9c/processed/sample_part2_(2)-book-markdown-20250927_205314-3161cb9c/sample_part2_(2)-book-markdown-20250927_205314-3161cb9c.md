How this book found its publisher is an unusual story. One of the authors was
meeting with a sales representative of another publishing company. In the course of
that conversation, it was discovered that these two people had a mutual friend-a
person who had encouraged the author to publish his first academic book about a
dozen years back when this friend was working for another publisher. The sales
representative passed along to the mutual friend that they (the author and the sales
rep) had met. That resulted in an e-mail reunion between the author and his old
friend, who let it be known that she now works for a textbook publishing company
called Unnamed Publisher. "Gee, would the company be interested in a one-
semester general, organic, and biochemistry text?" was the flippant response.
Wrong-or right, depending on your perspective-comment to make! Within an
hour (no joke), the editorial director of the company was on the phone with the
author, discussing the project and its possibilities. That talk lead to a discussion
between all the authors on the team, a visit by the editorial director to the first
author's hometown, and the subsequent signing of a contract for the book to be
published by Unnamed Publisher. So the initial thanks must go to Jen Welchans of
Unnamed Publisher for being the right person at the right place and the right time.
You never know when old friends will meet again and make good things happen.
Thanks, Jen.

Thanks to Michael Boezi, the editorial director of Unnamed Publisher, who always
gave enthusiastic support to this project (and still does). Thanks also to Jenn Yee,
project manager, who deftly dealt with 3 authors, 20 chapters, multiple reviews,
production issues, illustrations, and photos-and seemed to keep it all straight.
Kudos to the technology team at Unnamed Publisher, who had the ultimate job of
getting this book out: Brian Brennan, David Link, Christopher Loncar, Jessica Carey,
Jon Gottfried, Jon Williams, Katie Damo, Keith Avery, Mike Shnaydman, Po Ki Chui,
and Ryan Lowe. We would also like to thank the production team at Scribe, Inc.,
including Stacy Claxton, Chrissy Chimi, Melissa Tarrao, and Kevin McDermott. This
book would not exist without these people.

This project has benefited tremendously from the feedback of reviewers at several
stages in its development. We thank the following people for their input:

· David Bailey, Emporia State University

· Michael Bissell, Ohio State University

· Stephen Milczanowski, Florida State College at Jacksonville

Thanks especially to ANSR Source, who performed accuracy checks on various parts
of the text. Should any inaccuracies remain, they are the responsibility of the
authors. We hope that readers will let us know if they find any; one of the beauties
of the Flat World process is the ability to update the textbook quickly, so that it will
be an even better book tomorrow.

On a more personal level: RJS would like to thank her colleagues at Southern
Adventist University and her family and friends for their help and encouragement
during her work on this book. She is especially indebted to her sons, Michael and
Chris, for their patience and encouragement. JWH owes a special thanks to his
wonderful spouse, Ina, for doing so many things that allow him time to concentrate
on writing. Most of all, he is grateful for her boundless patience, unflagging
support, understanding, and enduring love. He is also grateful to his beloved
daughter, Cindy, for her help with the house and the yard and so many other
things. DWB thanks his wife, Gail, for things too numerous to mention but in
particular the constant support of and appreciation for the vagaries of an academic
life and for being the single parent on those nights when professional obligations
keep him out later than normal. Thanks also to his sons, Stuart and Casey-the
proverbial causes of gray hair-for being two of the (many) things worth living and
writing for.

# Preface

When a new entry-level textbook in chemistry comes out, the obvious first question
is "Why?" Why write another book when there are other texts available?

Actually, we had two main reasons. First, of all the textbooks that are available for a
one-semester general chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry (GOB) course,
virtually all are single-author textbooks. Why this one stands out-and, we would
argue, why this textbook might be preferable-is that the author team is composed
of chemistry faculty who specialize in the G part, the O part, and the B part. One of
us (DWB) is a physical chemist who spends a lot of time in the general chemistry
sequence, whether for nonscience majors, health profession majors, or science and
engineering majors. Another author (JWH) is an organic chemist by training and an
experienced textbook author, while the third author (RJS) is a biochemistry
professor and also a successful textbook author. All three authors are experienced,
successful teachers. Thus, right from the start, this author team brings the
appropriate experience and expertise that can combine to write a superior textbook
for this market.

The second reason was the opportunity presented by the unique publishing
strategy of Unnamed Publisher. The entire author team is excited about the
potential for online presentation of content in this Internet age. In addition to
having the content online, print copies of the textbook are readily available, as are
individual chapters, vocabulary cards, exercise solutions, and other products. The
easy availability of these items maximizes the ability of students to customize their
personal tools, increasing their chances for success in a one-semester chemistry
course.

This textbook is intended for the one-semester GOB course. Although a two-
semester GOB sequence is available at many colleges and universities, one-semester
GOB offerings are increasing in popularity. The need to cover so many topics in one
semester or quarter places additional pressure on the tools used to teach the
course, and the authors feel that a textbook developed explicitly for the one-
semester course will provide students with a superior educational experience. Many
one-semester GOB courses employ either a rewritten, watered-down two-semester
textbook or a bona fide two-semester textbook with cherry-picked topics. In the
opinion of this author team, neither choice provides students with the best learning
experience. This textbook does not have a two-semester counterpart. It was
developed specifically for the one-semester GOB course. As such, the chapters are
short and succinct, covering the fundamental material and leaving out the

<!-- PageNumber="6" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Preface" -->

extraneous. We recognize that students taking this particular course are likely
interested in health professions, such as nursing, occupational therapy, physical
therapy, physician assistance, and the like. As such, we have focused certain
examples and textbook features on these areas so students realize from the
beginning how these basic chemistry topics apply to their career choice.

This textbook is divided into approximately one-half general chemistry topics, one-
fourth organic chemistry topics, and one-fourth biochemistry topics. We feel that
these fractions provide the appropriate mix of chemistry topics for most students'
needs. The presentation is standard: there is no attempt to integrate organic and
biological chemistry throughout a general chemistry textbook, although there is an
early introduction to organic chemistry so that carbon-containing compounds can
be included as soon as possible. The first chapter stands out a bit for covering a
relatively large amount of material, but that is necessary. There is a certain skill set
that students must have to be successful in any GOB course, and rather than
relegate these skills to an appendix that is too often overlooked, the first chapter
covers them explicitly. Some of these topics can be omitted at the instructor's
discretion.

The G part of the textbook then continues into atoms and molecules, chemical
reactions, simple stoichiometry, energy, the phases of matter, solutions, and acids
and bases (including a short treatment of equilibrium) and then ends with nuclear
chemistry. The O part of the textbook starts with hydrocarbons and quickly covers
aromatic compounds and the basic functional groups, focusing on those functional
groups that have specific applications in biochemistry. The B part starts by
immediately applying the organic knowledge to carbohydrates and other
biologically important compounds. This section ends with a chapter on metabolism,
which is, after all, the ultimate goal for a textbook like this-a discussion of the
chemistry of life.

Each chapter is filled with example problems that illustrate the concepts at hand. In
the mathematical exercises, a consistent style of problem solving has been used. We
understand that there may be more than one way to solve a mathematical problem,
but having a consistent problem-solving style increases the chance for student
comprehension. Particular emphasis is placed on the units of quantities and how
they have to work out appropriately in algebraic treatments. For each example
problem, there is a Skill-Building Exercise immediately following that will help
students practice the very same concept but without an elaborate answer worked
out.

Every section of each chapter starts with one or more Learning Objectives that
preview the section. These Learning Objectives are echoed at the end of each

<!-- PageNumber="7" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="Preface" -->

section with Key Takeaways as well as Concept Review Exercises that ask about the
main ideas of the section. Sections then end with a set of exercises that students can
use to immediately put the knowledge of that section into practice. Most of the
exercises are paired, so that students can work two similar exercises for additional
practice. Finally, Additional Exercises at the end of each chapter ask more
challenging questions, bring multiple concepts together into a single exercise, or
extend the chapter concepts to broader perspectives. The complete exercise
portfolio of the textbook-Skill-Building Exercises, Concept Review Exercises, end-
of-section exercises, and Additional Exercises-provides multiple opportunities for
students to practice the content.

Other features in the textbook include Looking Closer, a chance to expand on a
topic more than a typical textbook would. We have selected topics that are relevant
and should appeal to students at this level. There are essays titled To Your Health
that focus on how some of the topics relate directly to health issues-the focus of
most of the students in this course. Do students realize that the simple act of
breathing, something most of us do without thinking, is a gas law in action? Most
chapters also have a Career Focus that presents an occupation related to the health
professions. Students at this level may not know exactly what they want to do in
the health professions, so having these essays gives some information about the
career possibilities awaiting them.

These features are kept to a minimum, however; this is a one-semester textbook
covering general chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. We recognize
that users appreciate features like this, but we also recognize the need to focus on
the core chemistry content. We hope we have reached an appropriate balance with
the amount of additional features.

We hope that this textbook meets your and your students' goals.

# Chapter 1 Chemistry, Matter, and Measurement


## Opening Essay

In April 2003, the US Pharmacopeia, a national organization that establishes quality standards for medications,
reported a case in which a physician ordered "morphine [a powerful painkiller] 2-3 mg IV [intravenously] every
2-3 hours for pain." A nurse misread the dose as "23 mg" and thus administered approximately 10 times the
proper amount to an 8-year-old boy with a broken leg. The boy stopped breathing but was successfully
resuscitated and left the hospital three days later.

Quantities and measurements are as important in our everyday lives as they are in medicine. The posted speed
limits on roads and highways, such as 55 miles per hour (mph), are quantities we might encounter all the time.
Both parts of a quantity, the amount (55) and the unit (mph), must be properly communicated to prevent
potential problems. In chemistry, as in any technical endeavor, the proper expression of quantities is a
necessary fundamental skill. As we begin our journey into chemistry, we will learn this skill so that errors-from
homework mistakes to traffic tickets to more serious consequences-can be avoided.

The study of chemistry will open your eyes to a fascinating world. Chemical
processes are continuously at work all around us. They happen as you cook and eat
food, strike a match, shampoo your hair, and even read this page. Chemistry is
called the central science because a knowledge of chemical principles is essential
for other sciences. You might be surprised at the extent to which chemistry
pervades your life.

### 1.1 What Is Chemistry?


## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1\. Define chemistry in relation to other sciences.

2\. Identify the general steps in the scientific method.

Chemistry1 is the study of matter-what it consists of, what its properties are, and
how it changes. Being able to describe the ingredients in a cake and how they
change when the cake is baked is called chemistry. Matter2 is anything that has
mass and takes up space-that is, anything that is physically real. Some things are
easily identified as matter-this book, for example. Others are not so obvious.
Because we move so easily through air, we sometimes forget that it, too, is matter.

Chemistry is one branch of science. Science3 is the process by which we learn about
the natural universe by observing, testing, and then generating models that explain
our observations. Because the physical universe is so vast, there are many different
branches of science (Figure 1.1 "The Relationships between Some of the Major
Branches of Science"). Thus, chemistry is the study of matter, biology is the study of
living things, and geology is the study of rocks and the earth. Mathematics is the
language of science, and we will use it to communicate some of the ideas of
chemistry.

Although we divide science into different fields, there is much overlap among them.
For example, some biologists and chemists work in both fields so much that their
work is called biochemistry. Similarly, geology and chemistry overlap in the field
called geochemistry. Figure 1.1 "The Relationships between Some of the Major
Branches of Science" shows how many of the individual fields of science are related.

1\. The study of matter.

2\. Anything that has mass and
takes up space.

3\. The process by which we learn
about the natural universe by
observing, testing, and then
generating models that explain
our observations.

### Looking Closer: Alchemy

As our understanding of the universe has changed over time, so has the
practice of science. Chemistry in its modern form, based on principles that we
consider valid today, was developed in the 1600s and 1700s. Before that, the
study of matter was known as alchemy and was practiced mainly in China,
Arabia, Egypt, and Europe.

Alchemy was a somewhat mystical and secretive approach to learning how to
manipulate matter. Practitioners, called alchemists, thought that all matter was
composed of different proportions of the four basic elements-fire, water,
earth, and air-and believed that if you changed the relative proportions of
these elements in a substance, you could change the substance. The long-
standing attempts to "transmute" common metals into gold represented one
goal of alchemy. Alchemy's other major goal was to synthesize the
philosopher's stone, a material that could impart long life-even immortality.
Alchemists used symbols to represent substances, some of which are shown in
the accompanying figure. This was not done to better communicate ideas, as
chemists do today, but to maintain the secrecy of alchemical knowledge,
keeping others from sharing in it.

In spite of this secrecy, in its time alchemy was respected as a serious, scholarly
endeavor. Isaac Newton, the great mathematician and physicist, was also an
alchemist.
