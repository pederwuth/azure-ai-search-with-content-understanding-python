        "overall_summary": "This book presents a systematic approach to modeling documents as collections of page objects that carry both visual form and machine-readable metadata. Beginning with a conceptual foundation in document structure and the roles different page objects play, it narrows focus to practical patterns and schemas you can use to make documents—and especially figures—explicitly interpretable by software. The narrative emphasizes how the same information is often represented in multiple modalities (visual graphics, captions, embedded tables, and metadata fields) and shows how formalizing those representations enhances clarity, reproducibility, and automated processing.\n\nA central case study—an annotated bar chart of monthly values—runs through the core ideas. The example figure includes a human caption, axis titles, a Markdown data table, an embedded textual description of colors, and explicit machine-readable fields. By documenting the same data in these multiple forms (bars, caption, table, metadata) the book demonstrates how a Figure page object can serve both human readers and downstream tools: it makes peaks and lows easy to see visually (April peak at 450, January low at 200), while also enabling exact data extraction and semantic understanding via fields like MarkdownDataTable and AxisTitles.\n\nThroughout, the book connects theory to practice. It shows how page object design choices—what metadata to include, how to encode axis labels or legend mappings, and how to represent annotations—affect discoverability, accessibility, and programmatic use. Chapters build from core definitions to concrete examples, schema recommendations, and implementation strategies, culminating in guidance for authors, publishers, and developers who want to create interoperable, machine-actionable documents.\n\nBy the end readers will understand not only why to make figures machine-readable, but how to do it in real documents. The book supplies patterns, a clear learning path from concepts to concrete artifacts, and practical techniques for embedding structured data (e.g., MarkdownDataTable, AxisTitles, color encodings) so that figures communicate reliably to both humans and machines.",
