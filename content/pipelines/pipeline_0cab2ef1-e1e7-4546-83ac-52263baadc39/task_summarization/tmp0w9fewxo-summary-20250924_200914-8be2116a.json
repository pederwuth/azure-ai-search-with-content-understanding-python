  "overall_summary": "This book presents a systematic approach to modeling the components of documents—especially figures—as discrete, richly annotated page objects that carry both visual and semantic metadata. Beginning with a high-level argument for treating page elements as first-class data structures, it quickly narrows into concrete patterns for representing figures: titles, chart types, captions, axis labels, explicit data lists, Markdown-formatted data tables, topic keywords, color encodings, and ancillary annotations such as footnotes. A running bar-chart example (January–June values) is used to demonstrate how these elements come together so that a figure is interpretable by both humans and machines.\n\nFrom that example the book develops methods for extracting and encoding figure information reproducibly. It shows how combining visual cues (colored bars, axis ticks) with embedded semantic fields (explicit value lists, axis titles, and machine-readable tables) resolves ambiguities that arise from purely visual or purely textual representations. Practical guidance is offered on annotating figcaptions and footnotes to anchor meaning, and on how to choose metadata fields so downstream consumers—search engines, data analysis pipelines, accessibility tools—can reliably find and use the data.\n\nLater chapters expand the pattern beyond single figures to the broader document ecology: how figure objects interact with tables, lists, captions, and surrounding narrative; conventions for linking figures to source data; and strategies for versioning, provenance, and automated validation. Implementation considerations cover schema design, export formats, and programmatic extraction and ingestion, with attention to reproducibility and machine interpretability.\n\nThe book closes by situating the figure-object pattern within practical workflows: publishing pipelines, data archival, automated content analysis, and accessible document design. Through examples, checklists, and recommended schemas, readers are given end-to-end guidance for adopting the approach in real-world systems—from authoring and editorial processes to downstream analytics and machine consumption.",

      "summary": "This chapter narrows the focus from the earlier, high-level discussion of page structure and object modeling to a concrete examination of the Figure page object. Building on prior chapters that introduced the idea of treating page elements as discrete objects with properties and semantics, Chapter 1 shows how a figure encapsulates both visual and semantic metadata: a caption, chart type, detailed description, a machine-readable data table and axis titles. Using a bar chart example that reports monthly values from January to June, the chapter demonstrates how the figure's metadata (title, chart type, topic keywords, explicit value list and a Markdown data table) complements the visual encoding (colored bars, axis labels) to make the data both human- and machine-interpretable.\n\nThe chapter emphasizes practical interpretation: identifying the peak month (April at 450) and the low point (January at 200), noting intermediate highs in March and May, and recognizing the deliberate color assignments across months. It highlights how footnotes, annotations and figcaptions (e.g., \"Figure 1: Here is a figure with text\") anchor meaning and provide contextual cues. Overall, this section advances understanding from abstract page-object concepts to a specific, reproducible pattern for representing and extracting chart data and metadata for downstream analysis.",
