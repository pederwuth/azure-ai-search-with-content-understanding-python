        "overall_summary": "This book explains how to treat elements of a document as structured \"page objects\" that carry both a visual presentation and a rich, machine-readable semantic description. It begins by introducing the page-object concept and the motivations for encoding not only how information looks on the page but also what it means: to improve interpretation, accessibility, automated processing, search, and reuse. Through concrete examples, the book demonstrates how combining rendered content with embedded metadata creates documents that serve both human readers and computational consumers.\n\nEarly chapters ground readers in fundamentals: what a page object is, how document structure differs from layout, and why explicit metadata matters. The book then drills into a sequence of practical, real-world examples. A detailed walkthrough of a bar chart page object is used to show how a figure, caption, and an associated metadata block can together capture title, chart type, topical keywords, a detailed textual description, an explicit data table, axis titles, and a short summary. This blend of visuals and descriptors shows how the same piece of content can support casual reading, accessibility tools, and downstream analytics.\n\nAs the narrative progresses, the book expands the repertoire of page objects and metadata patterns: tables, figures, equations, code listings, and complex composite layouts. It presents principles for choosing the right metadata fields, ways to represent tabular data (e.g., MarkdownDataTable), strategies for labeling axes and units, and practical conventions that preserve both human readability and machine interpretability. The book also examines how metadata supports tasks like automated extraction, content indexing, programmatic transformation, and reproducible research.\n\nFinally, the book offers guidance on implementing page-object systems in real workflows: embedding metadata in common formats, integrating with authoring tools, validating metadata quality, and balancing authoring cost with downstream benefits. Through a mix of conceptual frameworks, concrete examples, and applied recommendations, readers learn how to design documents whose presentation and semantics are tightly coupled, making them more accessible, discoverable, and actionable.",
