  "book_title": "Designing Page Objects: Structured Figures and Metadata for Interpretable Content",
  "overall_summary": "This book presents a practical, structured approach to representing the content of pages — particularly data visualizations — as discrete, well-specified page objects. It begins with foundational concepts that define what a page object is and why treating page content (text, figures, tables) as structured objects enables clearer communication, better accessibility, and more reliable downstream processing. From that foundation the narrative narrows to concrete element types, using the Figure as a focal example to show how visual artifacts should carry layered context: raw numeric data, machine-readable annotations, and human-oriented narrative captioning.\n\nUsing a single, detailed bar-chart example that encodes monthly values (200, 300, 400, 450, 350, 250), the book demonstrates how to combine a visual representation with embedded metadata such as title, chart type, topic keywords, axis titles, a markdown data table, and footnotes. The example is used to illustrate practical concerns — e.g., how to surface the peak (April, 450) and the trough (January, 200) in plain language; how to label axes for clarity; and how to include tabular data so that numerical values are explicitly available for reuse. These patterns are shown to support both human interpretation and automated analysis.\n\nA recurring emphasis is on designing page objects to be useful across contexts: accessibility (alt text and captions), machine consumption (structured fields like AxisTitles and MarkdownDataTable), and analytic workflows (preserving the underlying time-series values and metadata for business and finance scenarios). The book argues that when figures are packaged with these layers of context, they become reliable building blocks for downstream tasks such as reporting, data ingestion, and natural-language summarization.\n\nThroughout, the text balances conceptual framing with hands-on best practices and rationale. It shows how a disciplined page-object mindset reduces ambiguity, fosters reuse, and makes content more discoverable and auditable. By the end, readers have a clear model for creating figures and other page elements that serve both human readers and automated systems, with specific guidance on the metadata fields and narrative annotations that matter most.",

      "summary": "Building on earlier material that introduced the page object approach and content structure, this chapter drills into one concrete element type: the Figure (Section 2.2). It presents a bar chart example representing monthly values from January to June, accompanied by embedded metadata (title, chart type, topic keywords, a detailed description, a markdown data table and axis titles). The narrative and metadata make explicit how numeric data (200, 300, 400, 450, 350, 250) are encoded visually, and the short textual summary identifies April as the peak (450) and January as the trough (200).\n\nThe chapter ties the abstract notion of a page object to practical needs for interpretation, accessibility and downstream analysis: the figure includes both human-readable captioning and machine-friendly structured annotations (e.g., AxisTitles, MarkdownDataTable, and Footnotes). By layering raw numeric values, a natural-language summary, and structural labels (Months, Values), the example shows how a page object should carry enough context to support interpretation, reuse, and analytic workflows in business and finance scenarios.",
