The Preface also lays out the practical structure and teaching features used throughout: Learning Objectives, worked Example Problems paired with Skill‑Building Exercises, end‑of‑section Key Takeaways and Concept Review Exercises, and optional contextual pieces (Looking Closer, To Your Health, Career Focus) that connect chemical ideas to health careers.\n\nThe book begins by establishing foundational ideas in Chapter 1: definitions and classifications of matter, the particulate model (atoms, molecules, ions), and the quantitative habits of mind required for chemistry. An opening essay underscores the real‑world consequences of poor quantitative communication (for example, medication dosing errors) and motivates careful use of units, significant figures, and dimensional analysis. From this base the text moves through the essential topics of general chemistry (measurement and units; atomic and molecular structure; stoichiometry; bonding; states of matter; energetics; equilibrium; acids and bases) while interleaving an early, focused introduction to organic structure and reactivity so carbon chemistry can be applied promptly.\n\nThe organic and biochemistry portions occupy roughly a quarter of the course each and emphasize transferable skills: structural thinking, functional group recognition, reaction mechanisms at a conceptual level, and biochemical logic (macromolecules, metabolism, and molecular recognition) that is directly relevant to health fields. Chapters are intentionally short and skill oriented so instructors can tailor the sequence; worked problems and dimensional analysis are emphasized to build students’ quantitative confidence.

The authors emphasize two main motivations: (1) a multi-author team whose members are specialists in general chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, bringing targeted expertise to each portion of the course; and (2) an enthusiasm for a modern, flexible publishing model that includes online access to chapters, individual resources, and print copies to let students customize learning tools. The Preface positions the book explicitly for one-semester GOB courses (frequently populated by health-professions students) and argues that a purpose-built one-semester text is preferable to condensed or cherry-picked two-semester texts.\n\nThe Preface also outlines the book’s structure, pedagogy, and student-facing features. Content is roughly split into one-half general chemistry, one-quarter organic chemistry, and one-quarter biochemistry, with an early introduction to organic molecules so carbon chemistry can be used promptly. Chapters are intentionally short and focused; the first chapter collects essential prerequisite skills rather than hiding them in an appendix. Each section begins with Learning Objectives and ends with Key Takeaways and Concept Review Exercises; worked Example Problems are paired with immediate Skill-Building Exercises. Additional features include Looking Closer essays, To Your Health vignettes, and Career Focus pieces that tie topics to health professions, but these extras are kept minimal so the book stays centered on core chemistry concepts and skill development.",

It defines chemistry as the study of matter and its transformations and introduces a clear classification of matter (elements, compounds, mixtures; homogeneous vs. heterogeneous) and the distinction between physical and chemical properties and changes. The chapter also reviews basic particulate ideas — atoms, molecules, and ions — and ties macroscopic observations (color, phase, reactivity) to microscopic models that will be carried forward into both general chemistry and later organic/biochemical contexts.\n\nA substantial portion of the chapter is devoted to measurement and numerical reasoning: the International System of Units (SI) and commonly used metric units, unit prefixes, scientific notation, significant figures, accuracy vs. precision, error and uncertainty, dimensional analysis (unit conversions), and common laboratory quantities such as mass, volume, density, and temperature (°C, K, °F). Worked examples emphasize converting units, carrying correct significant figures, calculating density, and using dimensional analysis to avoid algebraic mistakes — practical skills essential for quantitative problem solving in subsequent chapters on stoichiometry, thermochemistry, and molecular structure. By combining conceptual classification of matter with rigorous measurement practice, the chapter sets both the conceptual and practical groundwork the authors noted in the Preface for an integrated single-semester GOB treatment.",

The anecdote (reported by the US Pharmacopeia) illustrates how the two parts of any quantity, the numerical amount and the unit, must be communicated and interpreted precisely; a misread unit or digit can produce errors ranging from minor inconveniences (a traffic ticket) to life‑threatening medical mistakes. The essay then broadens the point: measurements and quantities pervade everyday life (speed limits, recipes, medicine) and are a foundational skill in chemistry and other technical fields.\n\nThe essay also situates chemistry as the ‘‘central science’’ and previews the book’s approach: learning to express and use quantities correctly is one of the very first habits students must acquire. It points out that chemical processes are everywhere — cooking, combustion, cleaning, and even reading — so mastering measurement and the language of chemistry prepares students not only for more advanced topics in general and organic chemistry and biochemistry, but also for safer, clearer communication in practical contexts. This short opening thus serves as both a safety caution and a motivational bridge into Chapter 1’s formal treatment of what chemistry is and how we measure and describe matter.",

The chapter emphasizes that matter is anything with mass that occupies space and reminds readers that some everyday examples (like air) are matter even if we seldom notice them. It also highlights the role of mathematics as the language used to express chemical ideas and relationships.\n\nThe chapter places chemistry in the broader landscape of science, showing its central, interdisciplinary role connecting physics, biology, geology, medicine, and specialized subfields such as biochemistry and geochemistry. A brief historical perspective contrasts modern chemistry with alchemy, explaining how early, secretive alchemical practices (including attempts to transmute metals and synthesize a philosopher's stone) evolved into the evidence-based, open science of chemistry practiced since the 1600s and 1700s. The stated learning objectives (defining chemistry relative to other sciences and identifying steps of the scientific method) prepare students to approach the book's integrated general–organic–biochemistry curriculum with a common vocabulary and scientific mindset.",

          "summary": "The Preface explains why the authors created a new, single-semester general chemistry–organic chemistry–biochemistry (GOB) textbook and how it differs from other offerings. The authors emphasize two main motivations: (1) a multi-author team whose members are specialists in general chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, bringing targeted expertise to each portion of the course; and (2) an enthusiasm for a modern, flexible publishing model that includes online access to chapters, individual resources, and print copies to let students customize learning tools. The Preface positions the book explicitly for one-semester GOB courses (frequently populated by health-professions students) and argues that a purpose-built one-semester text is preferable to condensed or cherry-picked two-semester texts.\n\nThe Preface also outlines the book’s structure, pedagogy, and student-facing features. Content is roughly split into one-half general chemistry, one-quarter organic chemistry, and one-quarter biochemistry, with an early introduction to organic molecules so carbon chemistry can be used promptly. Chapters are intentionally short and focused; the first chapter collects essential prerequisite skills rather than hiding them in an appendix. Each section begins with Learning Objectives and ends with Key Takeaways and Concept Review Exercises; worked Example Problems are paired with immediate Skill-Building Exercises. Additional features include Looking Closer essays, To Your Health vignettes, and Career Focus pieces that tie topics to health professions, but these extras are kept minimal so the book stays centered on core chemistry concepts and skill development.",

          "summary": "Chapter 1 establishes the foundational language and quantitative habits of mind that the rest of this GOB textbook will build on. It defines chemistry as the study of matter and its transformations and introduces a clear classification of matter (elements, compounds, mixtures; homogeneous vs. heterogeneous) and the distinction between physical and chemical properties and changes. The chapter also reviews basic particulate ideas — atoms, molecules, and ions — and ties macroscopic observations (color, phase, reactivity) to microscopic models that will be carried forward into both general chemistry and later organic/biochemical contexts.\n\nA substantial portion of the chapter is devoted to measurement and numerical reasoning: the International System of Units (SI) and commonly used metric units, unit prefixes, scientific notation, significant figures, accuracy vs. precision, error and uncertainty, dimensional analysis (unit conversions), and common laboratory quantities such as mass, volume, density, and temperature (°C, K, °F). Worked examples emphasize converting units, carrying correct significant figures, calculating density, and using dimensional analysis to avoid algebraic mistakes — practical skills essential for quantitative problem solving in subsequent chapters on stoichiometry, thermochemistry, and molecular structure. By combining conceptual classification of matter with rigorous measurement practice, the chapter sets both the conceptual and practical groundwork the authors noted in the Preface for an integrated single-semester GOB treatment.",

          "summary": "This opening essay uses a stark real-world example — a pediatric morphine overdose caused by a misread dosage — to stress that quantities and their correct units are not abstract details but matters of safety and consequence. The anecdote (reported by the US Pharmacopeia) illustrates how the two parts of any quantity, the numerical amount and the unit, must be communicated and interpreted precisely; a misread unit or digit can produce errors ranging from minor inconveniences (a traffic ticket) to life‑threatening medical mistakes. The essay then broadens the point: measurements and quantities pervade everyday life (speed limits, recipes, medicine) and are a foundational skill in chemistry and other technical fields.\n\nThe essay also situates chemistry as the ‘‘central science’’ and previews the book’s approach: learning to express and use quantities correctly is one of the very first habits students must acquire. It points out that chemical processes are everywhere — cooking, combustion, cleaning, and even reading — so mastering measurement and the language of chemistry prepares students not only for more advanced topics in general and organic chemistry and biochemistry, but also for safer, clearer communication in practical contexts. This short opening thus serves as both a safety caution and a motivational bridge into Chapter 1’s formal treatment of what chemistry is and how we measure and describe matter.",

The chapter emphasizes that matter is anything with mass that occupies space and reminds readers that some everyday examples (like air) are matter even if we seldom notice them. It also highlights the role of mathematics as the language used to express chemical ideas and relationships.\n\nThe chapter places chemistry in the broader landscape of science, showing its central, interdisciplinary role connecting physics, biology, geology, medicine, and specialized subfields such as biochemistry and geochemistry. A brief historical perspective contrasts modern chemistry with alchemy, explaining how early, secretive alchemical practices (including attempts to transmute metals and synthesize a philosopher's stone) evolved into the evidence-based, open science of chemistry practiced since the 1600s and 1700s. The stated learning objectives (defining chemistry relative to other sciences and identifying steps of the scientific method) prepare students to approach the book's integrated general–organic–biochemistry curriculum with a common vocabulary and scientific mindset.",
