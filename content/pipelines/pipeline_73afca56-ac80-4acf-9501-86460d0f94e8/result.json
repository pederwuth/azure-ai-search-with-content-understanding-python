It begins by framing the purpose and scope of the work, defining audiences and the roadmap that guides readers through both conceptual ideas and hands-on approaches. The opening chapter establishes the organizing logic: why document structure matters, what questions the rest of the book will answer, and how the subsequent material builds toward operational systems.\n\nUsing Latin as a simple content example, the book then grounds abstract ideas in a concrete subject: what Latin is, where it originated, and why even a single content example can illuminate broader issues in text representation and historical data. This short, focused chapter signals how subject matter expertise and metadata interact — content must be known before it can be structured, annotated, or mined for insights.\n\nThe middle section turns to page-level objects and semantic markup. It explains how tables, figures, captions, headers, rows, and axis labels create machine- and human-readable structure on a page, and why clear captions and consistent headers are essential for downstream processing. Concrete mini-examples show how to encode tabular data and chart metadata to maximize interpretability and reusability.\n\nThe book culminates by introducing AI Document Intelligence as the practical technology that operationalizes these earlier concepts. It describes how automated extraction systems recover text, key-value pairs, tables, and page structure; contrasts prebuilt and customized models; and outlines deployment patterns (cloud, on-premises, SDK, and studio-based customization). Practical business use cases — document processing, knowledge mining, and industry-specific model customization — and pointers to demos connect the theoretical progression to real-world action, highlighting how properly structured documents enable automation, searchability, and analytics.",

The table example demonstrates structural elements (caption, header row, cells) with a tiny dataset (names and corp entries). The figure example embeds chart-like data and descriptive metadata (figcaption, monthly values, axis titles) and illustrates how a visual summary can be encoded alongside textual labels.\n\nTaken together, these examples show how semantic page objects support clarity and usability: captions and headers give context; structured rows and cells make tabular data machine- and human-readable; figcaptions and explicit axis labels make graphical data interpretable. This chapter thus advances the reader from understanding what the subject is (Chapter 2’s definition of Latin and its context) to understanding how to present subject-related data effectively on a page, establishing a foundation for later chapters that will likely cover richer content, annotation, and layout practices.",
