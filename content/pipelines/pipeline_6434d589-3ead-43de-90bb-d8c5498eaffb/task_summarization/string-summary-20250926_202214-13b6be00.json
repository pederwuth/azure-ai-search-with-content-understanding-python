  "overall_summary": "This book presents a practical, disciplined approach to treating figures and other visual elements as first-class page objects within digital documents. Beginning with foundational definitions of page objects and document structure, it frames figures not just as static images but as layered containers of meaning: visual marks, axis labels, embedded tabular data, captions, and explicit metadata annotations. The central example—a bar chart—is used throughout to ground abstract ideas in a concrete, reproducible case that links visual interpretation to underlying numeric truth.\n\nThe narrative then unfolds how each layer contributes to both human comprehension and machine processing. The figure example demonstrates axis titles, a MarkdownDataTable, a caption, a ChartType annotation, detailed value labels, color encodings by category, and keyword metadata. Readers learn to read a figure visually (spotting the April peak and January trough) and semantically (validating those readings against the Markdown table and axis labels), which illustrates how machine-readable fields and human-facing visuals complement one another.\n\nBuilding on the example, the book lays out practical methods for authoring and annotating figures so they become reliably extractable and interpretable by software: which metadata fields matter (ChartType, TopicKeywords, DetailedDescription, Summary, MarkdownDataTable), how to encode categorical colors, and how to structure captions for disambiguation. It also addresses validation and error-checking strategies—how to confirm that a visual peak corresponds to a numerical maximum in embedded data—and emphasizes accessibility and discoverability as design goals.\n\nFinally, the book situates these techniques within broader workflows for document engineering: pipeline design for data extraction, indexing and search using metadata, automated quality assurance, and authoring conventions that make documents both human-friendly and machine-actionable. By the end, readers will understand the theory, see detailed examples, and have concrete guidelines to produce figures that communicate clearly, validate reliably, and integrate smoothly into automated systems.",

      "summary": "This chapter drills into the \"Figure\" page object by presenting a concrete bar-chart example that links visual elements to underlying metadata and tabular data. Building on earlier coverage of page objects and document structure, it shows how a figure carries multiple layers of information: a caption (Figure 1: Here is a figure with text), axis titles (Months, Values), a Markdown data table, a chart type (bar), detailed value labels for January–June, and color encodings for month groupings. The narrative emphasizes reading the figure both visually and semantically — identifying the peak in April (450), the low in January (200), and intermediate highs in March (400) and May (350) — and using the provided table and axis labels to confirm numeric interpretation.\n\nThe chapter also demonstrates how annotations and metadata (ChartType, TopicKeywords, DetailedDescription, Summary, and MarkdownDataTable) work together to make a figure machine- and human-readable. It highlights the role of color encoding (orange for Jan & Apr, green for Feb & May, blue for Mar & Jun) as an explicit metadata attribute that aids quick pattern recognition. Overall, this example advances understanding from abstract page-object definitions to practical application: how to extract, validate, and interpret embedded data and descriptive fields within a figure object.",
