        "overall_summary": "This compilation presents the IMF's 2024 Article IV consultation for the United States: a press release, the staff report, informational annexes, and the U.S. Executive Director's statement. It opens by documenting the U.S. macroeconomic performance since the pandemic: output and employment have exceeded pre-pandemic forecasts, driven by large early fiscal support, housing and financial asset gains, substantial foreign-born labor inflows, and a rebound in productivity. Those forces produced an unusually resilient expansion even as inflation spiked in 2022 and the Federal Reserve tightened policy aggressively.\n\nFrom that diagnosis the report develops a conditional near-term outlook and policy implications. Staff project robust annualized growth in 2024, but sequential slowing toward potential output with a gradual rise in unemployment into 2025. A model-based box maps plausible federal funds rate paths consistent with PCE inflation returning to 2 percent in 2025, showing that the timing and pace of cuts hinge on structural parameters—Phillips curve steepness, inflation-expectations inertia, and demand interest-rate elasticities.\n\nThe narrative then pivots to medium- and long-term vulnerabilities. Despite low near-term sovereign stress, the report highlights a chronic fiscal imbalance: deficits and public debt are well above pre-pandemic expectations and, under current policies, are projected to rise further — general government gross debt could exceed 140 percent of GDP by the early 2030s. Staff outline the magnitude and composition of the problem, possible adjustment paths (tax reform, entitlement rebalancing, institutional fixes to the debt-limit process), and the recommended use of some savings to shore up targeted social programs.\n\nComplementary materials deepen the analysis: an assessment of whether the economy is back in balance (labor-market normalization, corporate margins, housing affordability); an empirical box on the effects of U.S. tariffs on China; a Risk Assessment Matrix that prioritizes geopolitical, commodity and fragmentation risks; a debt sustainability annex with stress tests; and progress on past IMF and FSAP recommendations. The U.S. Executive Director's statement largely concurs with staff on resilience and disinflation while emphasizing administration priorities (IRA, infrastructure, CHIPS), continued focus on financial stability, and the administration's proposed fiscal measures.",

            "summary": "This chapter presents the IMF's 2024 Article IV findings for the United States, delivered via a press release and staff report. Building on earlier material on the Article IV process and pandemic-era shocks, it emphasizes that the U.S. macroeconomy has been unusually resilient: output and employment exceed pre-pandemic expectations, with about 16 million jobs created since end-2020. The chapter attributes this strength to large, untargeted fiscal support in 2020–21 that boosted household savings and state/local buffers, a sharp rise in housing and financial asset prices that increased household wealth (especially for higher-income groups), and important supply-side gains—notably a sizable inflow of foreign-born workers and a rebound in productivity. At the same time, inflation spiked in 2022, prompting the Fed to raise rates by 525 bps; disinflation has proceeded with limited macro cost so far, and inflation is expected to reach the 2 percent target by mid-2025.",

The staff projects annualized GDP growth of about 2.6 percent in 2024, driven by continued robust demand, persistent supply‑side gains, and carryover momentum from the acceleration in activity during the second half of 2023. Despite these favorable tailwinds, the forecast anticipates a sequential slowdown through the year so that growth by 2024Q4 relative to 2023Q4 is closer to the economy's potential output.\n\nThe chapter also lays out the labor market trajectory and policy relevance: unemployment is expected to edge up gradually to around 4.25 percent by mid‑2025. That gradual rise implies a softening of labor market tightness over time, with clear implications for inflation dynamics and the Federal Reserve's policy stance—i.e., the case for moving away from emergency tightening is strengthened as demand cools toward potential and slack modestly increases. Overall, the chapter refines the narrative from Chapter 1 by converting observed resilience into a conditional outlook in which momentum coexists with an eventual return to trend growth and slower labor market conditions.",

            "summary": "Building on Chapter 1's diagnosis of U.S. macro resilience and Chapter 2's near-term outlook and monetary-policy implications, this box uses the Fed's semi-structural FRBUS model to map out a range of federal funds rate paths that are consistent with PCE inflation returning to 2 percent during 2025. The exercise compares a baseline calibration to three alternative parameterizations: a much steeper Phillips curve, less inertia in inflation expectations, and slightly weaker interest‑rate elasticities of domestic demand. Charts contrast these model-based optimal policy rules with the FOMC's SEP median and show how different assumptions shift the timing and pace of rate reductions through 2027.\n\nKey results are intuitive and policy‑relevant: if the Phillips curve is markedly steeper or inflation expectations are less sticky, disinflation proceeds faster and policymakers can front‑load rate cuts. Conversely, if domestic demand is less sensitive to interest rates (weaker interest‑rate elasticities), monetary policy must remain restrictive for longer and the first policy-rate reduction is postponed—potentially to the first half of 2025. Across scenarios the baseline paths broadly track the SEP median decline from roughly the mid‑5 percent area toward the mid‑3 percent range by 2027, but timing and depth of cuts vary importantly with model parameters, underscoring the role of structural uncertainty for policymaking.",

After the unprecedented fiscal response to the\nCOVID-19 outbreak, the budget deficit fell significantly in 2022 as pandemic-related fiscal measures\nunwound. However, the deficit rose again in 2023, driven by lower non-withheld income tax\nrevenues, higher interest costs, new outlays on student loan relief (the net present value of which is\nbooked in the current fiscal year), and increases in mandatory spending on income security.

The steady upward path for the public debt-GDP ratio represents a growing risk to the\nU.S. and global economy, potentially feeding into higher fiscal financing costs and a growing\nrisk to the smooth rollover of maturing obligations. Based on standard IMF tools, the risk of\nsovereign stress in the U.S. is low, public debt is sustainable, and the government has some fiscal\nspace (Annex II). Nonetheless, under current policies, the general government debt-GDP ratio is\nexpected to exceed 140 percent of GDP by 2032 and the general government deficit is expected to\nremain around 21/2 percent of GDP above the levels forecast at the time of the 2019 Article IV\nconsultation. Such chronic fiscal deficits-stemming in large part from growing outlays on health\nand social security associated with an aging population-represent a significant and persistent\npolicy misalignment that needs to be urgently addressed.\n\n20\\.\nD. The large fiscal deficit is also putting upward pressure on the current account deficit.\nThe 2023 current account was 0.7 percent of GDP larger than the norm (Annex III) with almost all of\nthe difference being accounted for by a larger-than-desirable fiscal deficit. The impact of the fiscal\ndissaving on the external position in 2023 is, though, being partially offset by an increase in\ncorporate net saving arising from higher after-tax profits (see below) and a modest decline in\ncorporate investment as a share of GDP.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"20\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\n21\\.

Achieving the needed realignment of the fiscal position will require going beyond\nfinding efficiencies in discretionary, non-defense federal spending (which makes up only\n15 percent of total federal outlays). Instead, the burden of adjustment will need to be borne by\nprogressive increases in the federal tax burden and a rebalancing of entitlement programs (notably\nsocial security and Medicare). A range of policy options-some of which are already included in the\npresident's budget proposal-are outlined in Box 8. Putting these measures in place will, though,\nnecessitate taking difficult political decisions over the course of multiple years.\n\n23\\. Some of the fiscal savings from these efforts should be deployed to increase spending\non programs to alleviate poverty. This should include reinstating a more generous, fully\nrefundable Child Tax Credit and raising the income threshold for eligibility for the EITC for workers\nwithout children. These programs have already proven the important impact they can have on\npoverty outcomes-particularly for children-but they should be more carefully targeted to lower\nincome households. Expanding such social assistance would be particularly important if there were\nto be an increased reliance on indirect taxes.\n\n24\\. The proposed medium-term adjustment would be expected to have a relatively small\neffect on U.S. growth. If much of the adjustment can take place through higher indirect taxation,\naccompanied by improvements in the social safety net and gradual changes to entitlement\nprograms, the multipliers would be expected to be relatively small. Also, any drag to growth would\nbe partly offset by somewhat lower interest rates-from both a lower path for the policy rate and\nsmaller term premia-as well as a somewhat weaker dollar. By reducing fiscal vulnerabilities,\nlowering interest rates, and weakening the dollar, the adjustment would create positive outward\nspillovers, particularly for countries with sizable dollar financing needs.\n\n25\\. The upcoming expiration of provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides an\nopportunity to engage in a broader societal discussion about tax reform and the need for\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\nadditional sources of revenue. 11 Provisions such as the reduction in the top individual income tax\nrate (from 39.6 to 37 percent), the deduction of 20 percent of qualified business income for pass-\nthroughs (i.e., partnerships, sole proprietors and S-corporations), and the higher minimum threshold\nfor the estate and gift tax should all be allowed to expire as scheduled. However, the increase in the\nstandard deduction and limits on itemized deductions (for state and local taxes and mortgage\ninterest) should be maintained as a permanent feature of the personal income tax. This would\nincrease equity and simplify the tax code. Consideration could also be given to allowing for the\npermanent full expensing of a range of corporate capital spending. In the event that some of the\nrevenue-losing provisions are renewed, they should be offset with other measures that raise\nrevenues by a comparable amount.\n\n26\\. There should be an effort to address the shortcomings in fiscal institutions that\nperiodically lead to political stand-offs over the debt limit and the funding of the federal\ngovernment. These create systemic risks to the U.S. and global economy that are entirely avoidable.\nInstitutional changes should be designed to ensure that, once appropriations are approved, the\ncorresponding space is added automatically to the debt ceiling. Similarly, in situations where the\nfunding of federal agencies lapses because of an inability to approve appropriations, provisions\nshould be made to automatically fund the federal government at some fraction of previous year's\nfunding until a full-year appropriations bill can be signed into law.\n\n27\\. Authorities' views. Even with enactment of the CHIPS Act, the Infrastructure Investment\nand Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the administration has lowered the federal deficit by\nover US$1 trillion and has enacted policies to raise revenues including through sizable investments\nin modernizing the Internal Revenue Service, a minimum tax on the profits of the largest\ncorporations, and a surcharge on stock buybacks. The President's 2025 Budget has proposed\nmeasures to reduce the federal deficit by an average of around 1 percent of GDP over the next\ndecade, including by raising the corporate tax rate and increasing the tax burden for those earning\nover US$400,000 per year. The budget also made the case to make permanent an expanded\nrefundable Child Tax Credit and a more generous EITC for workers without dependents. While\npersistently higher long-term interest rates could create a challenge to debt sustainability, the\nadministration is committed to maintaining a credible and sustainable fiscal path that stabilizes the\nreal net interest burden as a share of GDP. The repeated bouts of debt limit standoffs and possible\ngovernment shutdowns represent an unnecessary economic headwind and have the potential to\nseriously harm business and consumer confidence.\n\n11 Staff's fiscal forecast assumes that these provisions will sunset as scheduled. If all of the expiring provisions of the\n2017 Act were to be renewed, this would add around 1.7 percent of GDP to the federal budget deficit (see\nCongressional Budget Office).\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"22\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->",

            "chapter_title": "IS THE U.S. ECONOMY BACK IN BALANCE?\n\n28\\. There has been an impressively rapid repair of the economy following the turmoil\ncaused by COVID-19. As the U.S. emerged from the pandemic there were important concerns\nabout the potential hysteresis effects arising from declines in labor force participation (particularly\namong women, older workers, and lower income households), the tragic loss of life and talent\nduring COVID, long-term health effects, widespread bankruptcies (particularly among smaller\nbusinesses), and education losses suffered by students. Now, with the benefit of time, it has become\nclear that the active deployment of a range of policies during the pandemic has allowed the U.S. to\navoid many of these possible downsides. This is also a testament to the flexibility, dynamism and\ninnovativeness of the U.S. economic model.\n\n29\\. It is difficult to be definitive about whether the U.S. economy is fully back in balance.\nAny assessment is complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which the pandemic\nmaterially changed the underlying steady state (e.g., relative to that which prevailed in 2018-19\nwhen the economy appeared to be close to potential, at full employment, with inflation close to\ntarget, and policy broadly at neutral settings). Also, a number of secular transitions-lower carbon\nintensity, greater penetration of digital technologies, different modalities of work, and an aging\npopulation-are underway.\n\n30\\. Nonetheless, a stock-taking of the various dimensions of this important question\nseems worthwhile as the pandemic moves into the rear-view mirror:\n\n· The signs of supply-demand imbalances in the labor market have mostly dissipated. Levels\nof hiring, quits, layoffs, unemployment, measures of labor underutilization (e.g., U6), and the\nlevel of job-to-job transitions have, in broad terms, returned to levels seen in 2018-19. The rate\nof employment growth remains very high (2.8 million jobs were created over the past 12\nmonths) but this appears to be consistent with recent sizeable inflows of foreign-born labor.\nWhile the job opening rate is modestly above pre-pandemic levels, structural changes in the\nhiring process (notably the increased recourse to electronic platforms) meant that the openings\nrate had an upward trend even prior to the pandemic. This would imply the economy will settle\nat a somewhat higher rate of job openings than prevailed in 2019. Finally, nominal wage growth\nremains above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation. However, due to strong productivity,\nthe recent growth in unit labor costs has actually been at lower rates that were seen in 2018-19.\nFurthermore, the post-pandemic increase in corporate margins (see below) suggests that there\nis space for real wages and the labor share of income to rise without an increase in inflation.\n\n. The share of consumption accounted for by goods remains above pre-pandemic levels. The\npandemic triggered a marked shift in consumer demand from services to goods that has\nsubsequently reversed. However, even prior to 2020 there was an ongoing increase in the\nrelative share of goods in consumption-particularly durables-driven by rising incomes and a\nsecular decline in the relative price of goods versus services. After accounting for this prior trend,\nit appears that the swing back from goods to services consumption is largely complete.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"24\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\n\n<!-- FigureContent=\"**Title**: J2J Flow and Unemployment Rate\n**ChartType**: line\n**TopicKeywords**: Business and finance, Economics, Employment, Labor market\n**DetailedDescription**: The chart displays two lines representing the unemployment rate and job-to-job (J2J) transitions from 2010 Q1 to 2022 Q1.

The external position is broadly in line with the level implied by medium-term\nfundamentals and desirable policies (Annex III). While the current account deficit (at 3 percent\nof GDP in 2023) is somewhat above the norm, this is largely due to the effects of a larger-than-\ndesirable fiscal position. Similarly, while the U.S. dollar is around 10 percent above its pre-\npandemic levels, these gains can largely be accounted for by the strong cyclical position of the\nU.S. and improvements in the terms of trade (as the U.S. has become a net energy exporter). A\nmedium-term fiscal consolidation-undertaken by both the U.S. and its trading partners-would\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"25\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\nbe expected to bring the current account even closer to its medium-term norm and modestly\nweaken the dollar.\n\n. The real policy rate is well above neutral. With inflationary pressures remaining a concern, it\nis appropriate for the ex ante real federal funds rate to be above estimates of the neutral policy\nrate (although there is significant uncertainty about what the neutral rate will be once inflation is\ndecisively back at 2 percent).

If that proves to be true, in the coming years we should expect to see\na decline in rates of home ownership (and increase in rentals), slower rates of household\nformation, and a shift of demand toward smaller homes. Younger and lower-income households\nwould be most affected by these trends.\n\n. The public debt and deficit, as a share of GDP, are larger than prior to the pandemic. The\ngeneral government deficit is expected, over the medium-term, to remain around 21/2 percent of\nGDP higher than prior to the pandemic (split evenly between higher interest payments and a\nlooser primary balance). The public debt-GDP ratio is also well above levels expected just a few\nyears ago. This worsening of the fiscal position is perhaps the most visible and lasting imbalance\ncaused by the various policies undertaken during the pandemic. When combined with a likely\nincrease in financing costs (e.g., relative to the very low interest rates of the 2010's), the upward\nshift in debt and deficits is particularly troubling. As discussed above, developing a clear strategy\nfor reducing the debt and deficit over time will be essential. Such an adjustment would likely\nlead to lower interest rates, a weaker currency, and a CA deficit that is closer to the medium-\nterm norm.\n\n31\\. All in all, the evidence suggests the U.S. economy has largely returned to balance.\n\nMany of the imbalances that were catalyzed by the pandemic have unwound (notably with respect\nto labor markets, the composition of consumption, and the external position). Inflation is expected\nto soon return to target which will subsequently allow the monetary stance to normalize. There is\nsignificant uncertainty surrounding the prospects for corporate profitability and the relative price of\nhousing. However, the fiscal deficit remains much too large and will require decisive policy efforts to\naddress (see above). Addressing this fiscal imbalance through higher indirect taxes, increased\ntaxation of high-income individuals, eliminating poorly targeted tax expenditures, and making\ngradual parametric changes to entitlement programs should be expected to have relatively small\nmultiplier effects. However, such a change in the policy mix would allow for lower public debt-GDP,\na smaller CA deficit, and would put downward pressure on market interest rates. As such, it would\nlessen macroeconomic vulnerabilities and create positive outward spillovers (particularly to those\nwith sizable dollar financing needs).\n\n2\\. Authorities' views. Significant progress had been made in returning the economy to\nbalance after the extraordinary shocks experienced with the pandemic and the Russian invasion of\nUkraine. Based on a range of indicators, labor supply and demand had come into better balance\nover the past year. Supply chain disruptions had been largely resolved. Inflation is on a downward\npath and is expected to soon return to more normal levels. The child tax credit contained in the\nadministration's budget proposal, if enacted, would be an impactful tool to reduce poverty.

The chapter finds that many pandemic-driven imbalances have largely unwound: labor market measures (hiring, quits, layoffs, unemployment, U6, and job-to-job flows) broadly resemble 2018–19 levels; the pandemic-driven goods binge has reversed toward pre-existing trends; the external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals; and inflation is on a path back toward target, allowing monetary stance to normalize. At the same time, the real federal funds rate remains above neutral while that gap is expected to narrow as inflation decelerates (linking to the FRBUS analysis in Chapter 3).",

Impact of U.S. Tariffs\n\nIn May 2024, the U.S. announced recommendations to maintain Section 301 tariffs that were initially\nimposed on China in 2018 and 2019, and to add or increase tariffs for certain products. Evidence on the\nimpact of these measures shows that tariffs reconfigured supply chains, raised import prices and, overall,\nhad modest negative effects on the U.S. economy.\n\nU.S. firms and importers bore the brunt of the tariffs imposed on imports from China through a one-for-one\nincrease in import prices.1 However, the pass-through to retail prices was small with costs apparently\nabsorbed in corporate margins.\n\nOn balance, increased trade restrictions had a negative effect on U.S. welfare. The tariffs negatively impacted\nsectors that were exposed to the tariffs (e.g., through imported inputs), reducing export growth (Handley,\nKamal, and Monarch, 2020) and lowering employment in those sectors (Flaaen and Pierce 2019). Overall,\nthere was an estimated negative effect on U.S. welfare equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP (Fajgelbaum and\nKhandelwal, 2022). Similarly, Boer and Rieth (2024) argue that reversing the 2018-19 tariffs would raise\noutput by 0.4 percent after three years.\n\nThe tariffs have prompted a reconfiguration of supply chains, although links to China remain strong. U.S.\nimports from China dropped in sectors exposed to the tariffs, replaced by imports from other countries\n(particularly in strategic sectors). However, this may not have reduced reliance on China in U.S. supply chains\nas those countries that increased their exports to the U.S., on average, imported more from China (Freund et\nal, 2023). Gopinath et al (2024) highlights the emergence of connector countries where greater Chinese\npresence-measured either through exports or announced greenfield investments-has been correlated\nwith higher exports from that country to the U.S.\n\nRetaliation by China amplified the negative impact of the U.S. policies. In response to the 2018-19 tariffs,\nChina introduced its own restrictions on imports from the U.S., raising tariffs to around 21 percent on almost\n60 percent of imports from the U.S. These retaliatory tariffs reduced U.S. employment (Waugh, 2019).\nCaceres et al. (2019) assess that a 25 percent uniform tariff on Chinese imports, that is reciprocated by China,\nwould reduce U.S. output by 0.2 percent.\n\n1 See Amiti, Redding, and Weinstein (2019), Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy, and Khandelwal (2020); Cavallo, Gopinath,\nNeiman, and Tang, 2021; Flaaen, Hortacsu, and Tintelnot (2020), USITC (2023).",
            "summary": "This box examines the economic effects of the U.S. Section 301 tariffs on Chinese imports (2018–19) and subsequent trade-restrictive measures. Empirical evidence indicates the tariffs raised import prices one-for-one for U.S. firms and importers, while pass-through to consumer retail prices was limited as firms absorbed much of the cost in corporate margins. The measures prompted noticeable supply‑chain reconfiguration—imports from China fell in tariff‑exposed sectors and were partly replaced by other suppliers—but did not eliminate China’s role given increased Chinese content routed through ‘‘connector’’ countries. Retaliation by China magnified negative effects, denting sectoral employment and export growth and producing a modest but measurable welfare loss (estimated around 0.1 percent of GDP), with other studies suggesting that reversing the tariffs could raise output around 0.4 percent over three years.",

            "chapter_title": "Annex II. Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability Assessment\n\nFollowing the unprecedented fiscal response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the budget deficit returned to\npre-pandemic levels in 2022, only to be reversed in 2023 mainly due to lower income tax revenue and\nincreasing interest rates. Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to rise as a share of GDP\nover the medium-term as aging-related expenditures on health and social security feed into the debt\ndynamics. Gross financing needs are large, albeit manageable given the global reserve currency status\nof the U.S. dollar. A credible medium-term fiscal adjustment featuring reprioritization of budget\nprograms and revenue-gaining tax reform is needed to put public debt on a downward path.\nNonetheless, the risks of debt distress are low, and debt is viewed as sustainable.\n\n1\\. Background. An unprecedented level of fiscal expansion was introduced in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, leading to an increase in the fiscal deficit by over 8 percent of GDP. The\nsubsequent fiscal consolidations in 2021-22, as pandemic-related extraordinary measures were\nphased out, contributed to narrowing the budget deficit. However, the American Rescue Plan\n(enacted in March 2021), the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (enacted in November 2021),\nalong with the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act (both enacted in August 2022)\nslowed the pace of fiscal contraction, while weaker-than-expected income tax receipts widened\nfiscal deficits substantially.\n\n2\\.\nBaseline. The staff's baseline is based on current and likely-to-be-passed laws. Under this\nbaseline, public debt is expected to rise over the medium-term as age-related spending pressures\non entitlement programs assert themselves. Federal debt held by the public is projected to increase\nfrom about 97 percent of GDP in FY2023 to around 116 percent of GDP by 2033, with general\ngovernment gross debt rising from about 121 percent of GDP to 144 percent of GDP over the same\nperiod.\n\n3\\.\nAdjustment scenario. The general government primary deficit was 4.1 percent of GDP in\n2023 and is projected at 3.8 percent of GDP in 2024. Gradually raising the primary general\ngovernment surplus over the medium-term to around 1 percent of GDP (1.4 percent of GDP for the\nfederal government) would put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path. Staff views this\nadjustment as feasible. The target primary surplus would have to be larger to bring the debt ratio\ncloser to pre-Great Recession levels.\n\n4\\.\nDebt servicing costs. The debt projections have been adversely affected by the current and\nprojected deterioration in interest rate- growth differential, despite the safe-haven status of the\nUnited States. Under staff's baseline, the effective nominal interest rate is projected to stabilize at\n3.3 percent by 2033 after peaking at 4.0 percent in 2024. Government interest payments are\nexpected to rise with higher interest rates.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"47\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->",
            "summary": "Annex II builds a sovereign risk and debt sustainability assessment on the macro and policy context developed in earlier chapters. Drawing on the near-term growth and monetary policy outlook (Ch. 2), Fed rate mappings (Ch. 3), and the resilience diagnosis (Ch. 1), the Annex projects public debt dynamics under a baseline that incorporates current laws and likely legislated measures. Under that baseline federal debt held by the public rises from about 97 percent of GDP in FY2023 to ~116 percent by 2033 (general government gross debt from ~121% to ~144%). Debt accumulation is driven primarily by a persistent primary deficit, an adverse r–g (real interest rate minus growth) profile as interest costs rise with higher rates, and large gross financing needs that, while sizable, remain manageable given the U.S. dollar’s reserve status and deep domestic markets.\n\nThe Annex then layers stress and scenario analysis: an adjustment scenario that gradually lifts the general government primary balance to about a 1 percent surplus (1.4 percent for the federal government) would place the debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining track. Medium-term risk tools (debt fanchart/DFI and GFN financeability/GFI) flag a mixed picture — the Debt Fanchart Module signals marginally high risk because debt does not stabilize under baseline, while the GFN module signals moderate risk (DFI ~2.2; GFI ~15.8). Long-term modules emphasize demographic and health spending risks: aging and possible excess cost growth (ECG) materially raise long-run gross financing needs and debt (ECG at standard 1.4% would add roughly 7 pp to GFN and ~25 pp to debt by 2052). Overall, the Annex concludes that debt is sustainable and distress risk is low today, but a credible medium-term fiscal adjustment and reprioritization of spending/revenue measures are necessary to reduce vulnerabilities over time.",

Data collection from financial companies deemed \"covered reporters\" began in October 2019. This data collection requires the submission of information by central counterparties with average daily total open repo commitments of at least $50 billion. On May 6, 2024, the OFR promulgated a rule regarding \"Ongoing Data Collection of Non-centrally Cleared Bilateral Transactions in the U.S. Repurchase Agreement Market\" (part of 12 CFR 1610). Non-centrally cleared bilateral repo (NCCBR) transaction data is the last segment of repo data in the U.S. for which U.S. financial regulators have not had access to transaction-level data. This rule requires certain financial companies to report transaction-level NCCBR data on a daily basis. Companies that meet reporting thresholds have at least $10 billion in average daily total outstanding commitments to extend guarantees on and borrow cash through NCCBR transactions over all business days during the prior calendar quarter. Aggregated data from the cleared repo transaction OFR data collection, together with triparty repo data transaction data collected by the New York Federal Reserve Bank feed into the OFR's Short-Term Funding Monitor, which was launched in 2020. The Short-Term Funding Monitor includes the cleared repo and triparty repo daily preliminary and quarterly final aggregated data series and is available for download by the public via an application programming interface.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>FSAP Recommendations</th>\n<th>Responsible Authority</th>\n<th>Developments</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>In 2023, the OFR launched the Joint Analysis Data Environment (JADE). JADE is an OFR-hosted platform designed for Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) member agencies to analyze risks to financial stability. JADE is designed to support a wide array of financial stability research by combining public, proprietary and non- public government data in a single platform, accessible to researchers, analysts and support staff within OFR and FSOC member agencies. To facilitate collaborative research, JADE offers scalable, high-performance computing with analytical software and support for programming languages such as R and Python in a cloud-based environment with analysis-ready data. The platform is extensible and will expand as new financial risks are identified and new data becomes available. Because it was identified as a data gap by FSOC, climate-related financial risk is the first use case FSOC identified for JADE. As a result, JADE has been designed with analytical capabilities broader than has been typical of past financial data analytical platforms. As much of the data housed within JADE is non-public, JADE is available for use only by researchers, analysts, and support staff from OFR and FSOC member agencies.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Banking Regulation and Supervision</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Review prudential requirements for non- internationally active banks (Category III and IV)</td>\n<td>FRB, FDIC, OCC (S&amp;R/FBAs)</td>\n<td>The Board, FDIC, and OCC, continue to evaluate capital and liquidity requirements for these institutions.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"61\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"62\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>FSAP Recommendations</th>\n<th>Responsible Authority</th>\n<th>Developments</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>and ensure they are and continue to be broadly consistent with the Basel capital framework and appropriate concentration limits; and consider extending the full liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) to them.</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>The agencies issued the Basel III endgame proposal in July 2023 that would apply elements of the international standards to Category III and IV firms, including Basel's definition of capital (including the AOCI flow through) and the risk-based capital framework.

In October 2023, the Board adopted a final regulation implementing the Building Block Approach capital requirement, and the regulation became effective on January 1, 2024. The United States-along with other interested jurisdictions-is developing an Aggregation Method at the IAIS. The NAIC adopted the Group Capital Calculation in 2020 and over half the states now require the GCC to be filed, with all states expected to adopt the GCC by January 1, 2026, when it becomes an Accreditation Standard. The IAIS has developed high-level principles and criteria to assess whether the Aggregation Method provides comparable outcomes to the ICS by the end of the monitoring period. The Board and NAIC believe that the Aggregation Method is comparable to the ICS such that it should be considered by the IAIS and its member jurisdictions to be an outcome-equivalent approach for implementation of the ICS.

For example, the authorities continue to coordinate and collaborate on examinations of CCP risk management practices as well as on reviews of proposed changes to those frameworks, including rulemaking. As noted in the 2020 FSAP, authorities continue to analyze key risk management issues and work to address material differences in the outcomes of risk management practices at CCPs, taking into consideration the markets in which CCPs operate and the potential impacts to financial stability. Additionally, the FMU Committee process within the FSOC allows authorities to continue the periodic review of designated financial market utilities (DFMUs) and conduct ongoing monitoring of risks related to FMUs and payments, clearing, and settlement activities. The FMU Committee work is a critical part of the FSOC effort.

It records that the Federal Reserve raised policy rates rapidly to the recommended ~5.25% by July 2023 (consistent with the monetary policy discussion and Fed rate mappings in Chapters 2–3), while many structural fiscal and social recommendations—tax reform, broad supply-side measures (childcare, paid leave, immigration), and major safety net expansions—remain largely unaddressed though similar proposals appear in the president's budget. The Annex also catalogs concrete regulatory and supervisory progress: strengthened oversight of principal trading firms, central clearing requirements for UST‑collateralized repo, enhanced MMF liquidity and reporting rules, the Basel III ‘‘endgame’’ proposal extending elements of international standards to smaller U.S. banks, and substantial data-collection and analysis upgrades via the OFR (repo data collections, Short-Term Funding Monitor) and the JADE analytics platform.",

The pages shown list the U.S. membership date, Article VIII status, IMF quota (SDR 82,994.20), the IMF’s holdings of U.S. currency (SDR 60,424.18; 72.81 percent of quota), the reserve tranche position (SDR 22,570.07; 27.19 percent), and SDR Department allocations and holdings (net cumulative allocation SDR 114,861.89; holdings SDR 125,575.44 or 109.33 percent of allocation). No active IMF financial arrangements are recorded. These administrative data signal the U.S.’s central role in IMF resources and operations—relevant background when considering international cooperation on cross‑border corruption issues.\n\nWhile the title signals a focus on the cross‑border and systemic dimensions of corruption—illicit financial flows, asset recovery, AML/CFT cooperation, beneficial‑ownership transparency, and the interaction of sanctions and correspondent banking—the extract supplied emphasizes institutional context (U.S. IMF standing and resource positions). Building on earlier chapters’ diagnostics (resilience, monetary policy, sovereign debt risks, and recommended reforms), the annex situates the issue of transnational corruption within the framework of international financial capacity and cooperation: effective anti‑corruption action depends on coordinated cross‑border policy, enforcement capacity, and institutions that the U.S. and IMF help shape and finance.",

We broadly concur with staff's assessment of the U.S. economy, which has\nproven resilient and continues to see strong growth. We have seen a historic and equitable\neconomic recovery since the start of the Biden Administration, with an expanding labor force\nand low unemployment, rising business investment, and a significant decline in inflation. The\nFederal Reserve is adroitly managing the disinflation process. Moreover, the Administration has\nsupported the recovery by taking steps to safeguard financial stability and expand the economy's\nproductive capacity in a manner that is inclusive and environmentally sound. We believe that\nmaintaining prudent, forward-looking policies is the most effective way of supporting medium-\nto-long-term growth.\n\nAs staff note, the U.S. economy has turned in a remarkable performance over the past few\nyears, and the United States is the only G20 economy that is now operating above the levels\nof output and employment that were forecasted prior to the pandemic. The labor market\nremains healthy and is gradually easing toward stable and sustainable growth as labor supply and\ndemand realign. Carefully calibrated Federal Reserve monetary policy has seen inflation ease\nsignificantly since mid-2022, even with persistent economic growth and healthy labor markets.\nBusiness investment has grown rapidly, and we have had three record years of new business\napplications. We share staff's concerns about poverty and inequality but stress that we are\nwitnessing one of the most equitable economic recoveries in U.S. history, with large increases in\nBlack and Hispanic household wealth and disproportionate wage increases for low-income\nworkers. Although inflation remains higher than we would like, we expect rents and core\nservices inflation to further moderate over time, and we believe there is a path for further\ndisinflation while maintaining a healthy labor market. The U.S. banking sector remains sound\nand resilient, and banks have substantial capital to absorb losses and high levels of liquidity to\nmeet deposit outflows.\n\nLooking to the future, the Biden Administration is prioritizing historic investments aimed\nat boosting long-term productivity and addressing inequality. We are starting to reap the\nbenefits of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and CHIPS Act\nthrough increased investment in clean energy production, infrastructure, and manufacturing\nconstruction. Together, these key pieces of government legislation will increase competitiveness,\ntransform U.S. efforts to tackle climate change, and help to underpin long-term growth. For\ninstance, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $800 million in workforce development,\nthe CHIPS Act invests over $11 billion in Research and Development, and several of the IRA\nprovisions include bonus incentives for meeting prevailing wage and apprenticeship criteria. At\nthe same time, the Administration also remains committed to lowering costs for working families\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nand is working to bring down prescription drug costs, health insurance premiums, utility bills,\nand costs for everyday goods and services.",
            "summary": "This chapter reproduces the U.S. Executive Director's statement (July 17, 2024) which broadly concurs with Fund staff's positive assessment of the U.S. economy and underscores the authorities' view that recent performance reflects a resilient, inclusive recovery. Building on the resilience diagnosis and macro outlook from earlier chapters, the statement emphasizes strong labor market conditions, rapid business investment, and a marked decline in inflation driven by careful Federal Reserve policy. It highlights that the Administration sees recent bipartisan legislation (notably the Inflation Reduction Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and CHIPS Act) as central to boosting long‑run productivity, reshoring investment, supporting clean energy deployment, and advancing equitable outcomes for historically underserved groups.\n\nThe statement also addresses fiscal and financial stability matters that connect directly to prior debt and risk analysis. Authorities restate their belief that the current fiscal stance is appropriate for medium‑term growth, point to bipartisan legislation and a proposed budget intended to reduce deficits, and agree with staff that U.S. sovereign debt is at low overall risk of stress. They echo staff concerns about poverty increases after pandemic supports lapsed and set out administration priorities (e.g., expanded Child Tax Credit, targeted investments) to mitigate poverty and inequality. Finally, the statement affirms banking sector resilience and the Administration's commitment to coordinated climate and supply‑chain policies to support energy security and emissions reductions, complementing the Fund’s earlier technical assessments and recommendations.",

      "overall_summary": "This compilation presents the IMF's 2024 Article IV consultation for the United States: a press release, the staff report, informational annexes, and the U.S. Executive Director's statement. It opens by documenting the U.S. macroeconomic performance since the pandemic: output and employment have exceeded pre-pandemic forecasts, driven by large early fiscal support, housing and financial asset gains, substantial foreign-born labor inflows, and a rebound in productivity. Those forces produced an unusually resilient expansion even as inflation spiked in 2022 and the Federal Reserve tightened policy aggressively.\n\nFrom that diagnosis the report develops a conditional near-term outlook and policy implications. Staff project robust annualized growth in 2024, but sequential slowing toward potential output with a gradual rise in unemployment into 2025. A model-based box maps plausible federal funds rate paths consistent with PCE inflation returning to 2 percent in 2025, showing that the timing and pace of cuts hinge on structural parameters—Phillips curve steepness, inflation-expectations inertia, and demand interest-rate elasticities.\n\nThe narrative then pivots to medium- and long-term vulnerabilities. Despite low near-term sovereign stress, the report highlights a chronic fiscal imbalance: deficits and public debt are well above pre-pandemic expectations and, under current policies, are projected to rise further — general government gross debt could exceed 140 percent of GDP by the early 2030s. Staff outline the magnitude and composition of the problem, possible adjustment paths (tax reform, entitlement rebalancing, institutional fixes to the debt-limit process), and the recommended use of some savings to shore up targeted social programs.\n\nComplementary materials deepen the analysis: an assessment of whether the economy is back in balance (labor-market normalization, corporate margins, housing affordability); an empirical box on the effects of U.S. tariffs on China; a Risk Assessment Matrix that prioritizes geopolitical, commodity and fragmentation risks; a debt sustainability annex with stress tests; and progress on past IMF and FSAP recommendations. The U.S. Executive Director's statement largely concurs with staff on resilience and disinflation while emphasizing administration priorities (IRA, infrastructure, CHIPS), continued focus on financial stability, and the administration's proposed fiscal measures.",

          "summary": "This chapter presents the IMF's 2024 Article IV findings for the United States, delivered via a press release and staff report. Building on earlier material on the Article IV process and pandemic-era shocks, it emphasizes that the U.S. macroeconomy has been unusually resilient: output and employment exceed pre-pandemic expectations, with about 16 million jobs created since end-2020. The chapter attributes this strength to large, untargeted fiscal support in 2020–21 that boosted household savings and state/local buffers, a sharp rise in housing and financial asset prices that increased household wealth (especially for higher-income groups), and important supply-side gains—notably a sizable inflow of foreign-born workers and a rebound in productivity. At the same time, inflation spiked in 2022, prompting the Fed to raise rates by 525 bps; disinflation has proceeded with limited macro cost so far, and inflation is expected to reach the 2 percent target by mid-2025.",

The staff projects annualized GDP growth of about 2.6 percent in 2024, driven by continued robust demand, persistent supply‑side gains, and carryover momentum from the acceleration in activity during the second half of 2023. Despite these favorable tailwinds, the forecast anticipates a sequential slowdown through the year so that growth by 2024Q4 relative to 2023Q4 is closer to the economy's potential output.\n\nThe chapter also lays out the labor market trajectory and policy relevance: unemployment is expected to edge up gradually to around 4.25 percent by mid‑2025. That gradual rise implies a softening of labor market tightness over time, with clear implications for inflation dynamics and the Federal Reserve's policy stance—i.e., the case for moving away from emergency tightening is strengthened as demand cools toward potential and slack modestly increases. Overall, the chapter refines the narrative from Chapter 1 by converting observed resilience into a conditional outlook in which momentum coexists with an eventual return to trend growth and slower labor market conditions.",

          "summary": "Building on Chapter 1's diagnosis of U.S. macro resilience and Chapter 2's near-term outlook and monetary-policy implications, this box uses the Fed's semi-structural FRBUS model to map out a range of federal funds rate paths that are consistent with PCE inflation returning to 2 percent during 2025. The exercise compares a baseline calibration to three alternative parameterizations: a much steeper Phillips curve, less inertia in inflation expectations, and slightly weaker interest‑rate elasticities of domestic demand. Charts contrast these model-based optimal policy rules with the FOMC's SEP median and show how different assumptions shift the timing and pace of rate reductions through 2027.\n\nKey results are intuitive and policy‑relevant: if the Phillips curve is markedly steeper or inflation expectations are less sticky, disinflation proceeds faster and policymakers can front‑load rate cuts. Conversely, if domestic demand is less sensitive to interest rates (weaker interest‑rate elasticities), monetary policy must remain restrictive for longer and the first policy-rate reduction is postponed—potentially to the first half of 2025. Across scenarios the baseline paths broadly track the SEP median decline from roughly the mid‑5 percent area toward the mid‑3 percent range by 2027, but timing and depth of cuts vary importantly with model parameters, underscoring the role of structural uncertainty for policymaking.",

The steady upward path for the public debt-GDP ratio represents a growing risk to the\nU.S. and global economy, potentially feeding into higher fiscal financing costs and a growing\nrisk to the smooth rollover of maturing obligations. Based on standard IMF tools, the risk of\nsovereign stress in the U.S. is low, public debt is sustainable, and the government has some fiscal\nspace (Annex II). Nonetheless, under current policies, the general government debt-GDP ratio is\nexpected to exceed 140 percent of GDP by 2032 and the general government deficit is expected to\nremain around 21/2 percent of GDP above the levels forecast at the time of the 2019 Article IV\nconsultation. Such chronic fiscal deficits-stemming in large part from growing outlays on health\nand social security associated with an aging population-represent a significant and persistent\npolicy misalignment that needs to be urgently addressed.\n\n20\\.\nD. The large fiscal deficit is also putting upward pressure on the current account deficit.\nThe 2023 current account was 0.7 percent of GDP larger than the norm (Annex III) with almost all of\nthe difference being accounted for by a larger-than-desirable fiscal deficit. The impact of the fiscal\ndissaving on the external position in 2023 is, though, being partially offset by an increase in\ncorporate net saving arising from higher after-tax profits (see below) and a modest decline in\ncorporate investment as a share of GDP.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"20\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\n21\\.

Achieving the needed realignment of the fiscal position will require going beyond\nfinding efficiencies in discretionary, non-defense federal spending (which makes up only\n15 percent of total federal outlays). Instead, the burden of adjustment will need to be borne by\nprogressive increases in the federal tax burden and a rebalancing of entitlement programs (notably\nsocial security and Medicare). A range of policy options-some of which are already included in the\npresident's budget proposal-are outlined in Box 8. Putting these measures in place will, though,\nnecessitate taking difficult political decisions over the course of multiple years.\n\n23\\. Some of the fiscal savings from these efforts should be deployed to increase spending\non programs to alleviate poverty. This should include reinstating a more generous, fully\nrefundable Child Tax Credit and raising the income threshold for eligibility for the EITC for workers\nwithout children. These programs have already proven the important impact they can have on\npoverty outcomes-particularly for children-but they should be more carefully targeted to lower\nincome households. Expanding such social assistance would be particularly important if there were\nto be an increased reliance on indirect taxes.\n\n24\\. The proposed medium-term adjustment would be expected to have a relatively small\neffect on U.S. growth. If much of the adjustment can take place through higher indirect taxation,\naccompanied by improvements in the social safety net and gradual changes to entitlement\nprograms, the multipliers would be expected to be relatively small. Also, any drag to growth would\nbe partly offset by somewhat lower interest rates-from both a lower path for the policy rate and\nsmaller term premia-as well as a somewhat weaker dollar. By reducing fiscal vulnerabilities,\nlowering interest rates, and weakening the dollar, the adjustment would create positive outward\nspillovers, particularly for countries with sizable dollar financing needs.\n\n25\\. The upcoming expiration of provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides an\nopportunity to engage in a broader societal discussion about tax reform and the need for\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\nadditional sources of revenue. 11 Provisions such as the reduction in the top individual income tax\nrate (from 39.6 to 37 percent), the deduction of 20 percent of qualified business income for pass-\nthroughs (i.e., partnerships, sole proprietors and S-corporations), and the higher minimum threshold\nfor the estate and gift tax should all be allowed to expire as scheduled. However, the increase in the\nstandard deduction and limits on itemized deductions (for state and local taxes and mortgage\ninterest) should be maintained as a permanent feature of the personal income tax. This would\nincrease equity and simplify the tax code. Consideration could also be given to allowing for the\npermanent full expensing of a range of corporate capital spending. In the event that some of the\nrevenue-losing provisions are renewed, they should be offset with other measures that raise\nrevenues by a comparable amount.\n\n26\\. There should be an effort to address the shortcomings in fiscal institutions that\nperiodically lead to political stand-offs over the debt limit and the funding of the federal\ngovernment. These create systemic risks to the U.S. and global economy that are entirely avoidable.\nInstitutional changes should be designed to ensure that, once appropriations are approved, the\ncorresponding space is added automatically to the debt ceiling. Similarly, in situations where the\nfunding of federal agencies lapses because of an inability to approve appropriations, provisions\nshould be made to automatically fund the federal government at some fraction of previous year's\nfunding until a full-year appropriations bill can be signed into law.\n\n27\\. Authorities' views. Even with enactment of the CHIPS Act, the Infrastructure Investment\nand Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the administration has lowered the federal deficit by\nover US$1 trillion and has enacted policies to raise revenues including through sizable investments\nin modernizing the Internal Revenue Service, a minimum tax on the profits of the largest\ncorporations, and a surcharge on stock buybacks. The President's 2025 Budget has proposed\nmeasures to reduce the federal deficit by an average of around 1 percent of GDP over the next\ndecade, including by raising the corporate tax rate and increasing the tax burden for those earning\nover US$400,000 per year. The budget also made the case to make permanent an expanded\nrefundable Child Tax Credit and a more generous EITC for workers without dependents. While\npersistently higher long-term interest rates could create a challenge to debt sustainability, the\nadministration is committed to maintaining a credible and sustainable fiscal path that stabilizes the\nreal net interest burden as a share of GDP. The repeated bouts of debt limit standoffs and possible\ngovernment shutdowns represent an unnecessary economic headwind and have the potential to\nseriously harm business and consumer confidence.\n\n11 Staff's fiscal forecast assumes that these provisions will sunset as scheduled. If all of the expiring provisions of the\n2017 Act were to be renewed, this would add around 1.7 percent of GDP to the federal budget deficit (see\nCongressional Budget Office).\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"22\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->",

          "chapter_title": "IS THE U.S. ECONOMY BACK IN BALANCE?\n\n28\\. There has been an impressively rapid repair of the economy following the turmoil\ncaused by COVID-19. As the U.S. emerged from the pandemic there were important concerns\nabout the potential hysteresis effects arising from declines in labor force participation (particularly\namong women, older workers, and lower income households), the tragic loss of life and talent\nduring COVID, long-term health effects, widespread bankruptcies (particularly among smaller\nbusinesses), and education losses suffered by students. Now, with the benefit of time, it has become\nclear that the active deployment of a range of policies during the pandemic has allowed the U.S. to\navoid many of these possible downsides. This is also a testament to the flexibility, dynamism and\ninnovativeness of the U.S. economic model.\n\n29\\. It is difficult to be definitive about whether the U.S. economy is fully back in balance.\nAny assessment is complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which the pandemic\nmaterially changed the underlying steady state (e.g., relative to that which prevailed in 2018-19\nwhen the economy appeared to be close to potential, at full employment, with inflation close to\ntarget, and policy broadly at neutral settings). Also, a number of secular transitions-lower carbon\nintensity, greater penetration of digital technologies, different modalities of work, and an aging\npopulation-are underway.\n\n30\\. Nonetheless, a stock-taking of the various dimensions of this important question\nseems worthwhile as the pandemic moves into the rear-view mirror:\n\n· The signs of supply-demand imbalances in the labor market have mostly dissipated. Levels\nof hiring, quits, layoffs, unemployment, measures of labor underutilization (e.g., U6), and the\nlevel of job-to-job transitions have, in broad terms, returned to levels seen in 2018-19. The rate\nof employment growth remains very high (2.8 million jobs were created over the past 12\nmonths) but this appears to be consistent with recent sizeable inflows of foreign-born labor.\nWhile the job opening rate is modestly above pre-pandemic levels, structural changes in the\nhiring process (notably the increased recourse to electronic platforms) meant that the openings\nrate had an upward trend even prior to the pandemic. This would imply the economy will settle\nat a somewhat higher rate of job openings than prevailed in 2019. Finally, nominal wage growth\nremains above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation. However, due to strong productivity,\nthe recent growth in unit labor costs has actually been at lower rates that were seen in 2018-19.\nFurthermore, the post-pandemic increase in corporate margins (see below) suggests that there\nis space for real wages and the labor share of income to rise without an increase in inflation.\n\n. The share of consumption accounted for by goods remains above pre-pandemic levels. The\npandemic triggered a marked shift in consumer demand from services to goods that has\nsubsequently reversed. However, even prior to 2020 there was an ongoing increase in the\nrelative share of goods in consumption-particularly durables-driven by rising incomes and a\nsecular decline in the relative price of goods versus services. After accounting for this prior trend,\nit appears that the swing back from goods to services consumption is largely complete.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"24\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\n\n<!-- FigureContent=\"**Title**: J2J Flow and Unemployment Rate\n**ChartType**: line\n**TopicKeywords**: Business and finance, Economics, Employment, Labor market\n**DetailedDescription**: The chart displays two lines representing the unemployment rate and job-to-job (J2J) transitions from 2010 Q1 to 2022 Q1.

The external position is broadly in line with the level implied by medium-term\nfundamentals and desirable policies (Annex III). While the current account deficit (at 3 percent\nof GDP in 2023) is somewhat above the norm, this is largely due to the effects of a larger-than-\ndesirable fiscal position. Similarly, while the U.S. dollar is around 10 percent above its pre-\npandemic levels, these gains can largely be accounted for by the strong cyclical position of the\nU.S. and improvements in the terms of trade (as the U.S. has become a net energy exporter). A\nmedium-term fiscal consolidation-undertaken by both the U.S. and its trading partners-would\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"25\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\nbe expected to bring the current account even closer to its medium-term norm and modestly\nweaken the dollar.\n\n. The real policy rate is well above neutral. With inflationary pressures remaining a concern, it\nis appropriate for the ex ante real federal funds rate to be above estimates of the neutral policy\nrate (although there is significant uncertainty about what the neutral rate will be once inflation is\ndecisively back at 2 percent). However, it is expected that the gap between the policy rate and\nestimates of neutral will diminish in the coming months as inflation falls back to 2 percent.\n\n· Corporate margins rose markedly during\nthe pandemic.

On the other hand, competitive pressures and the entry of new firms may,\nover time, push margins lower.

If that proves to be true, in the coming years we should expect to see\na decline in rates of home ownership (and increase in rentals), slower rates of household\nformation, and a shift of demand toward smaller homes. Younger and lower-income households\nwould be most affected by these trends.\n\n. The public debt and deficit, as a share of GDP, are larger than prior to the pandemic. The\ngeneral government deficit is expected, over the medium-term, to remain around 21/2 percent of\nGDP higher than prior to the pandemic (split evenly between higher interest payments and a\nlooser primary balance). The public debt-GDP ratio is also well above levels expected just a few\nyears ago. This worsening of the fiscal position is perhaps the most visible and lasting imbalance\ncaused by the various policies undertaken during the pandemic. When combined with a likely\nincrease in financing costs (e.g., relative to the very low interest rates of the 2010's), the upward\nshift in debt and deficits is particularly troubling. As discussed above, developing a clear strategy\nfor reducing the debt and deficit over time will be essential. Such an adjustment would likely\nlead to lower interest rates, a weaker currency, and a CA deficit that is closer to the medium-\nterm norm.\n\n31\\. All in all, the evidence suggests the U.S. economy has largely returned to balance.\n\nMany of the imbalances that were catalyzed by the pandemic have unwound (notably with respect\nto labor markets, the composition of consumption, and the external position). Inflation is expected\nto soon return to target which will subsequently allow the monetary stance to normalize. There is\nsignificant uncertainty surrounding the prospects for corporate profitability and the relative price of\nhousing. However, the fiscal deficit remains much too large and will require decisive policy efforts to\naddress (see above). Addressing this fiscal imbalance through higher indirect taxes, increased\ntaxation of high-income individuals, eliminating poorly targeted tax expenditures, and making\ngradual parametric changes to entitlement programs should be expected to have relatively small\nmultiplier effects. However, such a change in the policy mix would allow for lower public debt-GDP,\na smaller CA deficit, and would put downward pressure on market interest rates. As such, it would\nlessen macroeconomic vulnerabilities and create positive outward spillovers (particularly to those\nwith sizable dollar financing needs).\n\n2\\. Authorities' views. Significant progress had been made in returning the economy to\nbalance after the extraordinary shocks experienced with the pandemic and the Russian invasion of\nUkraine. Based on a range of indicators, labor supply and demand had come into better balance\nover the past year. Supply chain disruptions had been largely resolved. Inflation is on a downward\npath and is expected to soon return to more normal levels. The child tax credit contained in the\nadministration's budget proposal, if enacted, would be an impactful tool to reduce poverty.

Impact of U.S. Tariffs\n\nIn May 2024, the U.S. announced recommendations to maintain Section 301 tariffs that were initially\nimposed on China in 2018 and 2019, and to add or increase tariffs for certain products. Evidence on the\nimpact of these measures shows that tariffs reconfigured supply chains, raised import prices and, overall,\nhad modest negative effects on the U.S. economy.\n\nU.S. firms and importers bore the brunt of the tariffs imposed on imports from China through a one-for-one\nincrease in import prices.1 However, the pass-through to retail prices was small with costs apparently\nabsorbed in corporate margins.\n\nOn balance, increased trade restrictions had a negative effect on U.S. welfare. The tariffs negatively impacted\nsectors that were exposed to the tariffs (e.g., through imported inputs), reducing export growth (Handley,\nKamal, and Monarch, 2020) and lowering employment in those sectors (Flaaen and Pierce 2019). Overall,\nthere was an estimated negative effect on U.S. welfare equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP (Fajgelbaum and\nKhandelwal, 2022). Similarly, Boer and Rieth (2024) argue that reversing the 2018-19 tariffs would raise\noutput by 0.4 percent after three years.\n\nThe tariffs have prompted a reconfiguration of supply chains, although links to China remain strong. U.S.\nimports from China dropped in sectors exposed to the tariffs, replaced by imports from other countries\n(particularly in strategic sectors). However, this may not have reduced reliance on China in U.S. supply chains\nas those countries that increased their exports to the U.S., on average, imported more from China (Freund et\nal, 2023). Gopinath et al (2024) highlights the emergence of connector countries where greater Chinese\npresence-measured either through exports or announced greenfield investments-has been correlated\nwith higher exports from that country to the U.S.\n\nRetaliation by China amplified the negative impact of the U.S. policies. In response to the 2018-19 tariffs,\nChina introduced its own restrictions on imports from the U.S., raising tariffs to around 21 percent on almost\n60 percent of imports from the U.S. These retaliatory tariffs reduced U.S. employment (Waugh, 2019).\nCaceres et al. (2019) assess that a 25 percent uniform tariff on Chinese imports, that is reciprocated by China,\nwould reduce U.S. output by 0.2 percent.\n\n1 See Amiti, Redding, and Weinstein (2019), Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy, and Khandelwal (2020); Cavallo, Gopinath,\nNeiman, and Tang, 2021; Flaaen, Hortacsu, and Tintelnot (2020), USITC (2023).",
          "summary": "This box examines the economic effects of the U.S. Section 301 tariffs on Chinese imports (2018–19) and subsequent trade-restrictive measures. Empirical evidence indicates the tariffs raised import prices one-for-one for U.S. firms and importers, while pass-through to consumer retail prices was limited as firms absorbed much of the cost in corporate margins. The measures prompted noticeable supply‑chain reconfiguration—imports from China fell in tariff‑exposed sectors and were partly replaced by other suppliers—but did not eliminate China’s role given increased Chinese content routed through ‘‘connector’’ countries. Retaliation by China magnified negative effects, denting sectoral employment and export growth and producing a modest but measurable welfare loss (estimated around 0.1 percent of GDP), with other studies suggesting that reversing the tariffs could raise output around 0.4 percent over three years.",

Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability Assessment\n\nFollowing the unprecedented fiscal response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the budget deficit returned to\npre-pandemic levels in 2022, only to be reversed in 2023 mainly due to lower income tax revenue and\nincreasing interest rates. Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to rise as a share of GDP\nover the medium-term as aging-related expenditures on health and social security feed into the debt\ndynamics. Gross financing needs are large, albeit manageable given the global reserve currency status\nof the U.S. dollar. A credible medium-term fiscal adjustment featuring reprioritization of budget\nprograms and revenue-gaining tax reform is needed to put public debt on a downward path.\nNonetheless, the risks of debt distress are low, and debt is viewed as sustainable.\n\n1\\. Background. An unprecedented level of fiscal expansion was introduced in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, leading to an increase in the fiscal deficit by over 8 percent of GDP. The\nsubsequent fiscal consolidations in 2021-22, as pandemic-related extraordinary measures were\nphased out, contributed to narrowing the budget deficit. However, the American Rescue Plan\n(enacted in March 2021), the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (enacted in November 2021),\nalong with the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act (both enacted in August 2022)\nslowed the pace of fiscal contraction, while weaker-than-expected income tax receipts widened\nfiscal deficits substantially.\n\n2\\.\nBaseline. The staff's baseline is based on current and likely-to-be-passed laws. Under this\nbaseline, public debt is expected to rise over the medium-term as age-related spending pressures\non entitlement programs assert themselves. Federal debt held by the public is projected to increase\nfrom about 97 percent of GDP in FY2023 to around 116 percent of GDP by 2033, with general\ngovernment gross debt rising from about 121 percent of GDP to 144 percent of GDP over the same\nperiod.\n\n3\\.\nAdjustment scenario. The general government primary deficit was 4.1 percent of GDP in\n2023 and is projected at 3.8 percent of GDP in 2024. Gradually raising the primary general\ngovernment surplus over the medium-term to around 1 percent of GDP (1.4 percent of GDP for the\nfederal government) would put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path. Staff views this\nadjustment as feasible. The target primary surplus would have to be larger to bring the debt ratio\ncloser to pre-Great Recession levels.\n\n4\\.\nDebt servicing costs. The debt projections have been adversely affected by the current and\nprojected deterioration in interest rate- growth differential, despite the safe-haven status of the\nUnited States. Under staff's baseline, the effective nominal interest rate is projected to stabilize at\n3.3 percent by 2033 after peaking at 4.0 percent in 2024. Government interest payments are\nexpected to rise with higher interest rates.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"47\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->",
          "summary": "Annex II builds a sovereign risk and debt sustainability assessment on the macro and policy context developed in earlier chapters. Drawing on the near-term growth and monetary policy outlook (Ch. 2), Fed rate mappings (Ch. 3), and the resilience diagnosis (Ch. 1), the Annex projects public debt dynamics under a baseline that incorporates current laws and likely legislated measures. Under that baseline federal debt held by the public rises from about 97 percent of GDP in FY2023 to ~116 percent by 2033 (general government gross debt from ~121% to ~144%). Debt accumulation is driven primarily by a persistent primary deficit, an adverse r–g (real interest rate minus growth) profile as interest costs rise with higher rates, and large gross financing needs that, while sizable, remain manageable given the U.S. dollar’s reserve status and deep domestic markets.\n\nThe Annex then layers stress and scenario analysis: an adjustment scenario that gradually lifts the general government primary balance to about a 1 percent surplus (1.4 percent for the federal government) would place the debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining track. Medium-term risk tools (debt fanchart/DFI and GFN financeability/GFI) flag a mixed picture — the Debt Fanchart Module signals marginally high risk because debt does not stabilize under baseline, while the GFN module signals moderate risk (DFI ~2.2; GFI ~15.8). Long-term modules emphasize demographic and health spending risks: aging and possible excess cost growth (ECG) materially raise long-run gross financing needs and debt (ECG at standard 1.4% would add roughly 7 pp to GFN and ~25 pp to debt by 2052). Overall, the Annex concludes that debt is sustainable and distress risk is low today, but a credible medium-term fiscal adjustment and reprioritization of spending/revenue measures are necessary to reduce vulnerabilities over time.",

This data collection requires the submission of information by central counterparties with average daily total open repo commitments of at least $50 billion. On May 6, 2024, the OFR promulgated a rule regarding \"Ongoing Data Collection of Non-centrally Cleared Bilateral Transactions in the U.S. Repurchase Agreement Market\" (part of 12 CFR 1610). Non-centrally cleared bilateral repo (NCCBR) transaction data is the last segment of repo data in the U.S. for which U.S. financial regulators have not had access to transaction-level data. This rule requires certain financial companies to report transaction-level NCCBR data on a daily basis. Companies that meet reporting thresholds have at least $10 billion in average daily total outstanding commitments to extend guarantees on and borrow cash through NCCBR transactions over all business days during the prior calendar quarter. Aggregated data from the cleared repo transaction OFR data collection, together with triparty repo data transaction data collected by the New York Federal Reserve Bank feed into the OFR's Short-Term Funding Monitor, which was launched in 2020.

To facilitate collaborative research, JADE offers scalable, high-performance computing with analytical software and support for programming languages such as R and Python in a cloud-based environment with analysis-ready data. The platform is extensible and will expand as new financial risks are identified and new data becomes available. Because it was identified as a data gap by FSOC, climate-related financial risk is the first use case FSOC identified for JADE. As a result, JADE has been designed with analytical capabilities broader than has been typical of past financial data analytical platforms. As much of the data housed within JADE is non-public, JADE is available for use only by researchers, analysts, and support staff from OFR and FSOC member agencies.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Banking Regulation and Supervision</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Review prudential requirements for non- internationally active banks (Category III and IV)</td>\n<td>FRB, FDIC, OCC (S&amp;R/FBAs)</td>\n<td>The Board, FDIC, and OCC, continue to evaluate capital and liquidity requirements for these institutions.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"61\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"62\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>FSAP Recommendations</th>\n<th>Responsible Authority</th>\n<th>Developments</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>and ensure they are and continue to be broadly consistent with the Basel capital framework and appropriate concentration limits; and consider extending the full liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) to them.</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>The agencies issued the Basel III endgame proposal in July 2023 that would apply elements of the international standards to Category III and IV firms, including Basel's definition of capital (including the AOCI flow through) and the risk-based capital framework.

In October 2023, the Board adopted a final regulation implementing the Building Block Approach capital requirement, and the regulation became effective on January 1, 2024. The United States-along with other interested jurisdictions-is developing an Aggregation Method at the IAIS. The NAIC adopted the Group Capital Calculation in 2020 and over half the states now require the GCC to be filed, with all states expected to adopt the GCC by January 1, 2026, when it becomes an Accreditation Standard. The IAIS has developed high-level principles and criteria to assess whether the Aggregation Method provides comparable outcomes to the ICS by the end of the monitoring period. The Board and NAIC believe that the Aggregation Method is comparable to the ICS such that it should be considered by the IAIS and its member jurisdictions to be an outcome-equivalent approach for implementation of the ICS.

It records that the Federal Reserve raised policy rates rapidly to the recommended ~5.25% by July 2023 (consistent with the monetary policy discussion and Fed rate mappings in Chapters 2–3), while many structural fiscal and social recommendations—tax reform, broad supply-side measures (childcare, paid leave, immigration), and major safety net expansions—remain largely unaddressed though similar proposals appear in the president's budget. The Annex also catalogs concrete regulatory and supervisory progress: strengthened oversight of principal trading firms, central clearing requirements for UST‑collateralized repo, enhanced MMF liquidity and reporting rules, the Basel III ‘‘endgame’’ proposal extending elements of international standards to smaller U.S. banks, and substantial data-collection and analysis upgrades via the OFR (repo data collections, Short-Term Funding Monitor) and the JADE analytics platform.",

No active IMF financial arrangements are recorded. These administrative data signal the U.S.’s central role in IMF resources and operations—relevant background when considering international cooperation on cross‑border corruption issues.\n\nWhile the title signals a focus on the cross‑border and systemic dimensions of corruption—illicit financial flows, asset recovery, AML/CFT cooperation, beneficial‑ownership transparency, and the interaction of sanctions and correspondent banking—the extract supplied emphasizes institutional context (U.S. IMF standing and resource positions). Building on earlier chapters’ diagnostics (resilience, monetary policy, sovereign debt risks, and recommended reforms), the annex situates the issue of transnational corruption within the framework of international financial capacity and cooperation: effective anti‑corruption action depends on coordinated cross‑border policy, enforcement capacity, and institutions that the U.S. and IMF help shape and finance.",

          "chapter_title": "Statement by Elizabeth Shortino, Executive Director for the United States, Amy Houpt Medearis, Senior Advisor to Executive Director, and David Wright, Advisor to Executive Director July 17, 2024\n\nWe thank the U.S. mission team, led by Nigel Chalk and Mai Chi Dao, for their policy advice\nand robust analysis. We broadly concur with staff's assessment of the U.S. economy, which has\nproven resilient and continues to see strong growth. We have seen a historic and equitable\neconomic recovery since the start of the Biden Administration, with an expanding labor force\nand low unemployment, rising business investment, and a significant decline in inflation. The\nFederal Reserve is adroitly managing the disinflation process. Moreover, the Administration has\nsupported the recovery by taking steps to safeguard financial stability and expand the economy's\nproductive capacity in a manner that is inclusive and environmentally sound. We believe that\nmaintaining prudent, forward-looking policies is the most effective way of supporting medium-\nto-long-term growth.\n\nAs staff note, the U.S. economy has turned in a remarkable performance over the past few\nyears, and the United States is the only G20 economy that is now operating above the levels\nof output and employment that were forecasted prior to the pandemic. The labor market\nremains healthy and is gradually easing toward stable and sustainable growth as labor supply and\ndemand realign. Carefully calibrated Federal Reserve monetary policy has seen inflation ease\nsignificantly since mid-2022, even with persistent economic growth and healthy labor markets.\nBusiness investment has grown rapidly, and we have had three record years of new business\napplications. We share staff's concerns about poverty and inequality but stress that we are\nwitnessing one of the most equitable economic recoveries in U.S. history, with large increases in\nBlack and Hispanic household wealth and disproportionate wage increases for low-income\nworkers. Although inflation remains higher than we would like, we expect rents and core\nservices inflation to further moderate over time, and we believe there is a path for further\ndisinflation while maintaining a healthy labor market. The U.S. banking sector remains sound\nand resilient, and banks have substantial capital to absorb losses and high levels of liquidity to\nmeet deposit outflows.\n\nLooking to the future, the Biden Administration is prioritizing historic investments aimed\nat boosting long-term productivity and addressing inequality. We are starting to reap the\nbenefits of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and CHIPS Act\nthrough increased investment in clean energy production, infrastructure, and manufacturing\nconstruction. Together, these key pieces of government legislation will increase competitiveness,\ntransform U.S. efforts to tackle climate change, and help to underpin long-term growth. For\ninstance, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $800 million in workforce development,\nthe CHIPS Act invests over $11 billion in Research and Development, and several of the IRA\nprovisions include bonus incentives for meeting prevailing wage and apprenticeship criteria. At\nthe same time, the Administration also remains committed to lowering costs for working families\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nand is working to bring down prescription drug costs, health insurance premiums, utility bills,\nand costs for everyday goods and services.",
          "summary": "This chapter reproduces the U.S. Executive Director's statement (July 17, 2024) which broadly concurs with Fund staff's positive assessment of the U.S. economy and underscores the authorities' view that recent performance reflects a resilient, inclusive recovery. Building on the resilience diagnosis and macro outlook from earlier chapters, the statement emphasizes strong labor market conditions, rapid business investment, and a marked decline in inflation driven by careful Federal Reserve policy. It highlights that the Administration sees recent bipartisan legislation (notably the Inflation Reduction Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and CHIPS Act) as central to boosting long‑run productivity, reshoring investment, supporting clean energy deployment, and advancing equitable outcomes for historically underserved groups.\n\nThe statement also addresses fiscal and financial stability matters that connect directly to prior debt and risk analysis. Authorities restate their belief that the current fiscal stance is appropriate for medium‑term growth, point to bipartisan legislation and a proposed budget intended to reduce deficits, and agree with staff that U.S. sovereign debt is at low overall risk of stress. They echo staff concerns about poverty increases after pandemic supports lapsed and set out administration priorities (e.g., expanded Child Tax Credit, targeted investments) to mitigate poverty and inequality. Finally, the statement affirms banking sector resilience and the Administration's commitment to coordinated climate and supply‑chain policies to support energy security and emissions reductions, complementing the Fund’s earlier technical assessments and recommendations.",
