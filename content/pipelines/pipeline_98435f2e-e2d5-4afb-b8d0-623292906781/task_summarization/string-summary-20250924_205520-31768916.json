  "overall_summary": "This book tells the story of how documents can be decomposed into rich, reusable page objects that serve both human readers and automated systems. It begins by defining the page-object model: a way to represent distinct logical elements of a document (text blocks, tables, images, figures, etc.) as first-class objects with standardized, machine-friendly metadata. From there it moves into practical schemas and examples that show how to annotate page objects so they carry presentation-ready content (captions, axis titles, figcaptions) and structured data (Markdown tables, explicit field names, topic keywords) simultaneously.\n\nA central strand of the narrative is the concrete treatment of visual objects—especially figures—demonstrating how a single figure can embed layered information for multiple uses. The book walks through a bar-chart figure example in depth: a monthly bar chart for January–June with values {Jan:200, Feb:300, Mar:400, Apr:450, May:350, Jun:250}, explicit axis titles 'Months' and 'Values', color-coded month groups, and an accompanying MarkdownDataTable and figcaption. That example shows both how to present the visual and how to make its data and semantics accessible for downstream tasks like search, analysis, or republishing.\n\nConceptually and practically, the book bridges high-level design principles and low-level implementation details. It shows how to choose metadata fields (ChartType, TopicKeywords, DetailedDescription, AxisTitles, FootnotesAndAnnotations), how to interpret and extract meaning from combined visual and textual signals, and how to structure annotations to support reuse, accessibility, and automation. Case examples and annotated objects make the approach concrete so readers can emulate the patterns in their own document collections.\n\nBy the end, readers will have a reproducible framework for turning messy documents into a palette of interoperable, semantically rich objects. The book argues that this decomposition improves clarity for human readers, makes documents easier to index and analyze, and unlocks new automation opportunities—transforming documents from static artifacts into structured, discoverable resources.",

      "summary": "This chapter drills into the 'Figure' page object as a concrete instantiation of the Page Objects concept introduced earlier. Where previous chapters defined the page object model, its purpose, and how different object types (text blocks, tables, images) are represented, this chapter focuses on a bar-chart figure that combines visual, textual, and tabular metadata. The chapter provides both human-readable elements (a figcaption: \"Figure 1: Here is a figure with text\") and machine-friendly metadata fields—ChartType, TopicKeywords, DetailedDescription, MarkdownDataTable, AxisTitles, and FootnotesAndAnnotations—illustrating how a single figure can carry layered information for presentation and analysis.\n\nThe chapter also explains how to interpret the contained data: a monthly bar chart for January–June with values {Jan:200, Feb:300, Mar:400, Apr:450, May:350, Jun:250}, color-coded by month groups (Jan & Apr in orange, Feb & May in green, Mar & Jun in blue), with axis titles 'Months' and 'Values'. It highlights the trend (peak in April at 450, low in January at 200, intermediate highs in March and May) and underscores that the figure pairs the visual chart with a Markdown data table and explicit axis labels, increasing clarity and reusability. This concrete example advances the reader's understanding of how visual objects in the page-object framework should be annotated and interpreted for both human consumption and downstream processing.",
