        "overall_summary": "This book reframes how we think about documents by treating each page as a first-class \"page object\" that combines visual elements, textual descriptions and structured metadata. It argues that pages — and especially figures within pages — are best understood not just as pixels or text runs but as composite objects whose parts (captions, axis labels, data tables, annotations) should be represented explicitly and linked. The result is a richer, more machine-actionable representation that preserves human interpretability while unlocking programmatic access.\n\nEarly chapters introduce the conceptual foundations: what a page object is, why page-level abstraction matters, and how visual, textual and structured components interact. A concrete running example — a bar-chart figure showing monthly values from January to June — is used to show how visual cues (coloured bars, axis ticks), written elements (caption, axis titles) and embedded structured data (a MarkdownDataTable, keywords, a DetailedDescription) can be combined to convey the same information redundantly and reliably. That example demonstrates how to represent trends (April peak, January low) and context (business/finance keywords) so both humans and tools can interpret them.\n\nThe middle of the book moves from theory and example to practice: metadata schemas for page objects, annotation strategies, techniques for linking visual elements to structured data, and best practices for embedding redundancy and semantic cues. It covers practical tooling and workflows for authoring, annotating and extracting page-object content, including guidelines for accessibility, provenance, and machine-readability. Evaluation approaches and metrics are presented to measure how well representations support retrieval, extraction and downstream analytics.\n\nIn closing, the book surveys real-world applications and case studies where page-object thinking improves outcomes — automated report generation, document search, visualization extraction for dashboards, and archival interoperability. It provides a forward-looking view on standards, tooling and research directions that can make documents more discoverable, interoperable and useful for both people and systems.",

By moving from conceptual page-object ideas to this concrete figure, the chapter demonstrates practical ways to represent and link graphic content, metadata and summary text so that both humans and tools can reliably interpret trends (peak in April, decline by June) and contextual metadata (business/finance topic keywords).",
