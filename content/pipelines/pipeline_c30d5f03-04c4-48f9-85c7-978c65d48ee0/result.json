        "overall_summary": "This report is the IMF's comprehensive assessment of the U.S. economy following the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent policy responses. It synthesizes staff analysis, an executive board press release, annexes on risk and debt sustainability, and a U.S. Executive Director statement to tell a single narrative: the U.S. has recovered impressively from the pandemic shock but now faces important medium‑term tradeoffs and vulnerabilities. The near‑term story emphasizes unusually strong demand resilience—fueled by large, front‑loaded fiscal support, elevated household savings, and sharp housing and equity wealth gains—that supported consumption even as monetary policy tightened to counter a 2022 inflation shock.\n\nThe report's outlook translates that diagnosis into policy implications: growth is projected to remain solid in 2024 but slow sequentially toward potential by year‑end, and the unemployment rate is expected to edge up into 2025. Monetary policy faces a delicate choice across scenarios—disinflation could permit easing sooner if inflation expectations re‑anchor and demand is sensitive to rates, but if demand is rate‑insensitive or inflation remains persistent, policy must stay restrictive longer. A scenario box using the Fed’s FRBUS model maps plausible federal funds rate paths consistent with returning PCE inflation to 2 percent in 2025, highlighting parameter uncertainty (Phillips curve slope, expectations inertia, interest‑rate elasticity of demand).\n\nA central medium‑term concern is fiscal: pandemic-era measures, subsequent policy choices, weaker-than-expected revenue, and rising interest costs have produced a materially higher public debt trajectory. Under current policies general government debt is projected to rise for years (reaching historic highs in the staff baseline), creating a need for roughly a 4 percent of GDP adjustment over time to put debt clearly on a downward path—most likely through progressive tax increases, repricing and rebalancing of entitlement programs, and better fiscal institutions. The report stresses careful sequencing to limit macro drag (favoring offsetting revenue, phased entitlements adjustments, targeted social‑safety-net spending) and highlights the external and global spillovers of U.S. fiscal policy.\n\nComplementary chapters and annexes evaluate structural and distributional legacies (housing affordability, elevated corporate margins, child poverty reversal after pandemic supports ended), quantify sovereign risk and gross financing needs (annex II), assess the economic costs of trade restrictions (Section 301 tariffs), map global shock scenarios with policy responses (risk matrix), and review implementation progress on prior IMF recommendations and financial‑stability reforms. The Executive Director’s statement broadly concurs with the staff diagnosis while emphasizing the Administration’s policy priorities—productive investments, equitable recovery, and continued attention to fiscal sustainability—closing the loop between analysis and the U.S. authorities’ perspective.",

            "summary": "This chapter deepens the IMF staff’s examination of the United States’ post‑pandemic macroeconomic performance by linking demand‑side resilience with recent supply‑side developments and policy responses. Building on the report’s earlier overview of the U.S. economy and policy context, it documents how very large, front‑loaded fiscal support in 2020–21, elevated household savings, and a pronounced rise in housing and equity prices together fueled robust consumption. At the same time, the chapter highlights important distributional and social costs: real incomes were temporarily compressed by the 2022 inflation spike, gains in wealth were concentrated at the top, and poverty—especially child poverty—increased after pandemic era supports expired. The staff show that housing wealth, and an increased elasticity of consumption to housing wealth (especially for homeowners without mortgages), accounted for much of the consumption rebound.",

Despite these tailwinds, the economy is expected to slow in sequential terms, lowering the\n2024Q4/Q4 growth rate to close to the growth in potential output.

            "summary": "Building on Chapter 1’s diagnosis of pronounced demand‑side resilience and recent supply‑side improvements and policy responses, Chapter 2 translates those developments into a short‑term macro outlook and draws out the implications for monetary policy. The staff projects that strong demand, ongoing supply gains, and a significant carryover from the acceleration in activity in 2023H2 will produce an annualized growth rate of about 2.6 percent in 2024. However, that headline pace masks a sequential slowdown: by the end of 2024 (Q4/Q4) growth is expected to have moderated to a rate close to potential output. As the cyclical boost fades, the unemployment rate is projected to rise gradually to roughly 4.25 percent by mid‑2025.\n\nAgainst this backdrop the chapter emphasizes policy tradeoffs. The combination of moderating growth, improving supply capacity, and a gradually softening labor market should, other things equal, take pressure off inflation and alter the policy calculus facing the Federal Reserve. Policymakers must weigh persistent demand strengths and upside risks against the anticipated slowdown and rising unemployment when deciding whether to sustain, tighten, or begin to ease the currently restrictive stance. The chapter therefore frames monetary policy as needing to respond to sequential dynamics (the carryover effect and the move toward potential output) as much as to current high‑frequency indicators.",

Possible Paths for the Federal Funds Rate\n\nSimulations from the Fed's semi-structural FRBUS model show that a range of potential paths for the federal\nfunds rate would be consistent with PCE inflation returning to 2 percent during 2025. Optimal rate paths are\nderived based on:",
            "summary": "Building on Chapter 1’s diagnosis of strong demand‑side resilience and recent supply developments and Chapter 2’s short‑term macro outlook and monetary policy implications, this box uses the Fed’s semi‑structural FRBUS model to map out federal funds rate paths that bring PCE inflation back to 2 percent in 2025. The exercise computes “optimal” policy trajectories under alternative parameterizations of the model—specifically a much steeper Phillips curve, less sticky inflation expectations, and somewhat lower interest‑rate sensitivity of domestic demand—and compares those trajectories with the SEP median and different output‑gap policy rules. Across scenarios the model projects policy rates around the mid‑to‑high single digits in late‑2024, declining gradually through 2027, but the timing and front‑loading of cuts vary meaningfully with the assumed parameters.\n\nThe key result is intuitive but policy‑relevant: if inflation reacts more strongly to slack (a steeper Phillips curve) or if expectations re‑anchor more quickly (less inertia), disinflation proceeds faster and the Federal Reserve can reduce rates earlier and more front‑loaded. Conversely, if domestic demand is less responsive to higher rates, policy must remain restrictive for longer and rate cuts are deferred (first reductions pushed into H1 2025). The box therefore translates the diagnostic and outlook work in Chapters 1–2 into concrete policy‑path uncertainty, underscoring the importance of monitoring inflation expectations and demand sensitivity when setting the timing of rate easing.",

After the unprecedented fiscal response to the\nCOVID-19 outbreak, the budget deficit fell significantly in 2022 as pandemic-related fiscal measures\nunwound. However, the deficit rose again in 2023, driven by lower non-withheld income tax\nrevenues, higher interest costs, new outlays on student loan relief (the net present value of which is\nbooked in the current fiscal year), and increases in mandatory spending on income security. The\ncombined effect was a 3.5 percent of GDP\nwidening of the general government deficit in\nGeneral Government Gross Debt\n(percent of GDP)\n2023\\.

The steady upward path for the public debt-GDP ratio represents a growing risk to the\nU.S. and global economy, potentially feeding into higher fiscal financing costs and a growing\nrisk to the smooth rollover of maturing obligations. Based on standard IMF tools, the risk of\nsovereign stress in the U.S. is low, public debt is sustainable, and the government has some fiscal\nspace (Annex II). Nonetheless, under current policies, the general government debt-GDP ratio is\nexpected to exceed 140 percent of GDP by 2032 and the general government deficit is expected to\nremain around 21/2 percent of GDP above the levels forecast at the time of the 2019 Article IV\nconsultation. Such chronic fiscal deficits-stemming in large part from growing outlays on health\nand social security associated with an aging population-represent a significant and persistent\npolicy misalignment that needs to be urgently addressed.\n\n20\\.\nD. The large fiscal deficit is also putting upward pressure on the current account deficit.\nThe 2023 current account was 0.7 percent of GDP larger than the norm (Annex III) with almost all of\nthe difference being accounted for by a larger-than-desirable fiscal deficit. The impact of the fiscal\ndissaving on the external position in 2023 is, though, being partially offset by an increase in\ncorporate net saving arising from higher after-tax profits (see below) and a modest decline in\ncorporate investment as a share of GDP.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"20\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\n21\\.

Achieving the needed realignment of the fiscal position will require going beyond\nfinding efficiencies in discretionary, non-defense federal spending (which makes up only\n15 percent of total federal outlays). Instead, the burden of adjustment will need to be borne by\nprogressive increases in the federal tax burden and a rebalancing of entitlement programs (notably\nsocial security and Medicare). A range of policy options-some of which are already included in the\npresident's budget proposal-are outlined in Box 8. Putting these measures in place will, though,\nnecessitate taking difficult political decisions over the course of multiple years.\n\n23\\. Some of the fiscal savings from these efforts should be deployed to increase spending\non programs to alleviate poverty. This should include reinstating a more generous, fully\nrefundable Child Tax Credit and raising the income threshold for eligibility for the EITC for workers\nwithout children. These programs have already proven the important impact they can have on\npoverty outcomes-particularly for children-but they should be more carefully targeted to lower\nincome households. Expanding such social assistance would be particularly important if there were\nto be an increased reliance on indirect taxes.\n\n24\\. The proposed medium-term adjustment would be expected to have a relatively small\neffect on U.S. growth. If much of the adjustment can take place through higher indirect taxation,\naccompanied by improvements in the social safety net and gradual changes to entitlement\nprograms, the multipliers would be expected to be relatively small. Also, any drag to growth would\nbe partly offset by somewhat lower interest rates-from both a lower path for the policy rate and\nsmaller term premia-as well as a somewhat weaker dollar. By reducing fiscal vulnerabilities,\nlowering interest rates, and weakening the dollar, the adjustment would create positive outward\nspillovers, particularly for countries with sizable dollar financing needs.\n\n25\\. The upcoming expiration of provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides an\nopportunity to engage in a broader societal discussion about tax reform and the need for\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\nadditional sources of revenue. 11 Provisions such as the reduction in the top individual income tax\nrate (from 39.6 to 37 percent), the deduction of 20 percent of qualified business income for pass-\nthroughs (i.e., partnerships, sole proprietors and S-corporations), and the higher minimum threshold\nfor the estate and gift tax should all be allowed to expire as scheduled. However, the increase in the\nstandard deduction and limits on itemized deductions (for state and local taxes and mortgage\ninterest) should be maintained as a permanent feature of the personal income tax. This would\nincrease equity and simplify the tax code. Consideration could also be given to allowing for the\npermanent full expensing of a range of corporate capital spending. In the event that some of the\nrevenue-losing provisions are renewed, they should be offset with other measures that raise\nrevenues by a comparable amount.\n\n26\\. There should be an effort to address the shortcomings in fiscal institutions that\nperiodically lead to political stand-offs over the debt limit and the funding of the federal\ngovernment. These create systemic risks to the U.S. and global economy that are entirely avoidable.\nInstitutional changes should be designed to ensure that, once appropriations are approved, the\ncorresponding space is added automatically to the debt ceiling. Similarly, in situations where the\nfunding of federal agencies lapses because of an inability to approve appropriations, provisions\nshould be made to automatically fund the federal government at some fraction of previous year's\nfunding until a full-year appropriations bill can be signed into law.\n\n27\\. Authorities' views. Even with enactment of the CHIPS Act, the Infrastructure Investment\nand Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the administration has lowered the federal deficit by\nover US$1 trillion and has enacted policies to raise revenues including through sizable investments\nin modernizing the Internal Revenue Service, a minimum tax on the profits of the largest\ncorporations, and a surcharge on stock buybacks. The President's 2025 Budget has proposed\nmeasures to reduce the federal deficit by an average of around 1 percent of GDP over the next\ndecade, including by raising the corporate tax rate and increasing the tax burden for those earning\nover US$400,000 per year. The budget also made the case to make permanent an expanded\nrefundable Child Tax Credit and a more generous EITC for workers without dependents. While\npersistently higher long-term interest rates could create a challenge to debt sustainability, the\nadministration is committed to maintaining a credible and sustainable fiscal path that stabilizes the\nreal net interest burden as a share of GDP. The repeated bouts of debt limit standoffs and possible\ngovernment shutdowns represent an unnecessary economic headwind and have the potential to\nseriously harm business and consumer confidence.\n\n11 Staff's fiscal forecast assumes that these provisions will sunset as scheduled. If all of the expiring provisions of the\n2017 Act were to be renewed, this would add around 1.7 percent of GDP to the federal budget deficit (see\nCongressional Budget Office).\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"22\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->",
            "summary": "Chapter 4 builds directly on the macro diagnosis in Chapters 1–3 by turning attention from demand, supply, and monetary-policy dynamics to a mounting fiscal problem: a chronic and growing general government deficit and public debt trajectory that is materially above pre-pandemic forecasts. After pandemic relief faded, the deficit narrowed in 2022 but widened again in 2023 because of weaker non-withheld income tax receipts, higher interest costs, student‑loan relief accounting, and rising mandatory income‑security outlays. Under current policy settings, general government debt is projected to keep climbing—exceeding 140 percent of GDP by 2032—and deficits remain roughly 2½ percent of GDP above the 2019 Article IV baseline, representing a persistent policy misalignment driven largely by aging‑related entitlement spending.\n\nThe chapter quantifies the adjustment challenge (roughly a 4 percent of GDP fiscal tightening or a shift to a primary surplus near 1 percent of GDP to put debt on a clear downward path) and outlines policy routes and tradeoffs. Because discretionary non‑defense spending is only about 15 percent of outlays, the recommended burden of consolidation falls mainly on higher (progressive) taxes and rebalancing of entitlement programs (Social Security, Medicare), while preserving or expanding well‑targeted anti‑poverty measures (e.g., refundable Child Tax Credit, expanded EITC for childless workers). The chapter also stresses complementary measures: letting many 2017 tax provisions sunset to raise revenue, improving IRS capacity, fixing debt‑limit and continuing‑resolution mechanics to avoid destabilizing standoffs, and sequencing reforms to limit macro drag—favoring indirect taxation and phased changes to entitlements to lower multipliers and produce beneficial spillovers via lower interest rates and a weaker dollar.",

            "chapter_title": "IS THE U.S. ECONOMY BACK IN BALANCE?\n\n28\\. There has been an impressively rapid repair of the economy following the turmoil\ncaused by COVID-19. As the U.S. emerged from the pandemic there were important concerns\nabout the potential hysteresis effects arising from declines in labor force participation (particularly\namong women, older workers, and lower income households), the tragic loss of life and talent\nduring COVID, long-term health effects, widespread bankruptcies (particularly among smaller\nbusinesses), and education losses suffered by students. Now, with the benefit of time, it has become\nclear that the active deployment of a range of policies during the pandemic has allowed the U.S. to\navoid many of these possible downsides. This is also a testament to the flexibility, dynamism and\ninnovativeness of the U.S. economic model.\n\n29\\. It is difficult to be definitive about whether the U.S. economy is fully back in balance.\nAny assessment is complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which the pandemic\nmaterially changed the underlying steady state (e.g., relative to that which prevailed in 2018-19\nwhen the economy appeared to be close to potential, at full employment, with inflation close to\ntarget, and policy broadly at neutral settings). Also, a number of secular transitions-lower carbon\nintensity, greater penetration of digital technologies, different modalities of work, and an aging\npopulation-are underway.\n\n30\\. Nonetheless, a stock-taking of the various dimensions of this important question\nseems worthwhile as the pandemic moves into the rear-view mirror:\n\n· The signs of supply-demand imbalances in the labor market have mostly dissipated. Levels\nof hiring, quits, layoffs, unemployment, measures of labor underutilization (e.g., U6), and the\nlevel of job-to-job transitions have, in broad terms, returned to levels seen in 2018-19. The rate\nof employment growth remains very high (2.8 million jobs were created over the past 12\nmonths) but this appears to be consistent with recent sizeable inflows of foreign-born labor.\nWhile the job opening rate is modestly above pre-pandemic levels, structural changes in the\nhiring process (notably the increased recourse to electronic platforms) meant that the openings\nrate had an upward trend even prior to the pandemic. This would imply the economy will settle\nat a somewhat higher rate of job openings than prevailed in 2019. Finally, nominal wage growth\nremains above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation. However, due to strong productivity,\nthe recent growth in unit labor costs has actually been at lower rates that were seen in 2018-19.\nFurthermore, the post-pandemic increase in corporate margins (see below) suggests that there\nis space for real wages and the labor share of income to rise without an increase in inflation.\n\n. The share of consumption accounted for by goods remains above pre-pandemic levels. The\npandemic triggered a marked shift in consumer demand from services to goods that has\nsubsequently reversed. However, even prior to 2020 there was an ongoing increase in the\nrelative share of goods in consumption-particularly durables-driven by rising incomes and a\nsecular decline in the relative price of goods versus services. After accounting for this prior trend,\nit appears that the swing back from goods to services consumption is largely complete.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"24\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\n\n<!-- FigureContent=\"**Title**: J2J Flow and Unemployment Rate\n**ChartType**: line\n**TopicKeywords**: Business and finance, Economics, Employment\n**DetailedDescription**: The chart displays two lines representing the unemployment rate and J2J transitions from 2010 Q1 to 2022 Q1.

The external position is broadly in line with the level implied by medium-term\nfundamentals and desirable policies (Annex III). While the current account deficit (at 3 percent\nof GDP in 2023) is somewhat above the norm, this is largely due to the effects of a larger-than-\ndesirable fiscal position. Similarly, while the U.S. dollar is around 10 percent above its pre-\npandemic levels, these gains can largely be accounted for by the strong cyclical position of the\nU.S. and improvements in the terms of trade (as the U.S. has become a net energy exporter). A\nmedium-term fiscal consolidation-undertaken by both the U.S. and its trading partners-would\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"25\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\nbe expected to bring the current account even closer to its medium-term norm and modestly\nweaken the dollar.\n\n. The real policy rate is well above neutral. With inflationary pressures remaining a concern, it\nis appropriate for the ex ante real federal funds rate to be above estimates of the neutral policy\nrate (although there is significant uncertainty about what the neutral rate will be once inflation is\ndecisively back at 2 percent).

If that proves to be true, in the coming years we should expect to see\na decline in rates of home ownership (and increase in rentals), slower rates of household\nformation, and a shift of demand toward smaller homes. Younger and lower-income households\nwould be most affected by these trends.\n\n. The public debt and deficit, as a share of GDP, are larger than prior to the pandemic. The\ngeneral government deficit is expected, over the medium-term, to remain around 21/2 percent of\nGDP higher than prior to the pandemic (split evenly between higher interest payments and a\nlooser primary balance). The public debt-GDP ratio is also well above levels expected just a few\nyears ago. This worsening of the fiscal position is perhaps the most visible and lasting imbalance\ncaused by the various policies undertaken during the pandemic. When combined with a likely\nincrease in financing costs (e.g., relative to the very low interest rates of the 2010's), the upward\nshift in debt and deficits is particularly troubling. As discussed above, developing a clear strategy\nfor reducing the debt and deficit over time will be essential. Such an adjustment would likely\nlead to lower interest rates, a weaker currency, and a CA deficit that is closer to the medium-\nterm norm.\n\n31\\. All in all, the evidence suggests the U.S. economy has largely returned to balance.\n\nMany of the imbalances that were catalyzed by the pandemic have unwound (notably with respect\nto labor markets, the composition of consumption, and the external position). Inflation is expected\nto soon return to target which will subsequently allow the monetary stance to normalize. There is\nsignificant uncertainty surrounding the prospects for corporate profitability and the relative price of\nhousing. However, the fiscal deficit remains much too large and will require decisive policy efforts to\naddress (see above). Addressing this fiscal imbalance through higher indirect taxes, increased\ntaxation of high-income individuals, eliminating poorly targeted tax expenditures, and making\ngradual parametric changes to entitlement programs should be expected to have relatively small\nmultiplier effects. However, such a change in the policy mix would allow for lower public debt-GDP,\na smaller CA deficit, and would put downward pressure on market interest rates. As such, it would\nlessen macroeconomic vulnerabilities and create positive outward spillovers (particularly to those\nwith sizable dollar financing needs).\n\n2\\. Authorities' views. Significant progress had been made in returning the economy to\nbalance after the extraordinary shocks experienced with the pandemic and the Russian invasion of\nUkraine. Based on a range of indicators, labor supply and demand had come into better balance\nover the past year. Supply chain disruptions had been largely resolved. Inflation is on a downward\npath and is expected to soon return to more normal levels. The child tax credit contained in the\nadministration's budget proposal, if enacted, would be an impactful tool to reduce poverty. Finally,\nsupply side reforms, including those legislated in the Inflation Reduction Act, Infrastructure,\n\n12 Estimates from the Federal Home Finance Agency point to lock-in effects leading to a 57 percent reduction in\nhome sales in 2023Q4 which reduced activity, created constraints on mobility, and boosted housing prices.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 27\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\nInvestment, and Jobs Act, and CHIPS Act, are working to relieve bottlenecks, increase labor\nproductivity, and address climate challenges.

            "summary": "Chapter 5 takes stock of whether the U.S. economy has returned to a balanced, pre‑pandemic steady state. Building on the diagnostic lens of Chapter 1 (demand resilience and recent supply improvements) and the short‑term macro and policy framing of Chapters 2–3, the chapter concludes that many pandemic‑related imbalances have largely unwound. Labor market indicators (hiring, quits, layoffs, unemployment, U6, and job‑to‑job flows) have broadly returned to 2018–19 levels, consumption patterns have shifted back toward services after the goods spike, and poverty has reverted to roughly pre‑pandemic rates following the expiration of pandemic supports. Inflation is on a downward path, which should allow monetary policy to normalize as the ex‑ante real federal funds rate moves back toward neutral. The external position is broadly consistent with medium‑term fundamentals, with the current account modestly wide largely because of the larger fiscal deficit.\n\nAt the same time, the chapter highlights important persistent and emerging imbalances. Corporate profit margins have risen markedly and may or may not retrace to pre‑pandemic norms, implying distributional and inflationary considerations. Housing affordability remains a major and potentially long‑lasting imbalance — prices are roughly 50 percent higher than before the pandemic, inventory and turnover are low, and lock‑in effects from low fixed‑rate mortgages constrain mobility. The public debt‑to‑GDP ratio and structural deficit are materially higher than pre‑pandemic forecasts, posing a medium‑term vulnerability that would benefit from a credible fiscal consolidation (with attendant effects on interest rates, the dollar, and the current account). Financial stability risks have moderated since the 2023 Article IV review, but pockets of vulnerability remain — especially office CRE exposure concentrated in smaller and regional banks, nonbank mortgage servicing resilience, and concentration of uninsured deposits. The chapter also describes recent Treasury‑market resilience reforms and flags growing trade and industrial policy distortions (tariffs, domestic content subsidies, export controls) as a downside risk to both U.S. and global growth.",

Impact of U.S. Tariffs\n\nIn May 2024, the U.S. announced recommendations to maintain Section 301 tariffs that were initially\nimposed on China in 2018 and 2019, and to add or increase tariffs for certain products. Evidence on the\nimpact of these measures shows that tariffs reconfigured supply chains, raised import prices and, overall,\nhad modest negative effects on the U.S. economy.\n\nU.S. firms and importers bore the brunt of the tariffs imposed on imports from China through a one-for-one\nincrease in import prices.1 However, the pass-through to retail prices was small with costs apparently\nabsorbed in corporate margins.\n\nOn balance, increased trade restrictions had a negative effect on U.S. welfare. The tariffs negatively impacted\nsectors that were exposed to the tariffs (e.g., through imported inputs), reducing export growth (Handley,\nKamal, and Monarch, 2020) and lowering employment in those sectors (Flaaen and Pierce 2019). Overall,\nthere was an estimated negative effect on U.S. welfare equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP (Fajgelbaum and\nKhandelwal, 2022). Similarly, Boer and Rieth (2024) argue that reversing the 2018-19 tariffs would raise\noutput by 0.4 percent after three years.\n\nThe tariffs have prompted a reconfiguration of supply chains, although links to China remain strong. U.S.\nimports from China dropped in sectors exposed to the tariffs, replaced by imports from other countries\n(particularly in strategic sectors). However, this may not have reduced reliance on China in U.S. supply chains\nas those countries that increased their exports to the U.S., on average, imported more from China (Freund et\nal, 2023). Gopinath et al (2024) highlights the emergence of connector countries where greater Chinese\npresence-measured either through exports or announced greenfield investments-has been correlated\nwith higher exports from that country to the U.S.\n\nRetaliation by China amplified the negative impact of the U.S. policies. In response to the 2018-19 tariffs,\nChina introduced its own restrictions on imports from the U.S., raising tariffs to around 21 percent on almost\n60 percent of imports from the U.S. These retaliatory tariffs reduced U.S. employment (Waugh, 2019).\nCaceres et al. (2019) assess that a 25 percent uniform tariff on Chinese imports, that is reciprocated by China,\nwould reduce U.S. output by 0.2 percent.\n\n1 See Amiti, Redding, and Weinstein (2019), Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy, and Khandelwal (2020); Cavallo, Gopinath,\nNeiman, and Tang, 2021; Flaaen, Hortacsu, and Tintelnot (2020), USITC (2023).",
            "summary": "This box evaluates the economic impact of U.S. tariffs on China (Section 301 measures from 2018–19 and related 2024 recommendations to maintain or expand them). Empirical evidence shows the tariffs raised import costs for U.S. firms and importers roughly one-for-one, but only minimally passed through to consumer retail prices; instead, firms absorbed much of the cost in margins. The measures prompted significant reconfiguration of supply chains: U.S. imports from China fell in tariff-exposed sectors and were partly replaced by other exporters, but those substitute suppliers often increased their own links to China (the emergence of “connector” countries), meaning dependence on Chinese inputs did not disappear. Overall macro effects were modestly negative — reducing output and employment in exposed sectors, dampening export growth, and lowering welfare in estimates ranging from a welfare loss of about 0.1 percent of GDP to a potential 0.4 percent output gain from reversing the tariffs after a few years.",

            "chapter_title": "Annex II. Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability Assessment\n\nFollowing the unprecedented fiscal response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the budget deficit returned to\npre-pandemic levels in 2022, only to be reversed in 2023 mainly due to lower income tax revenue and\nincreasing interest rates. Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to rise as a share of GDP\nover the medium-term as aging-related expenditures on health and social security feed into the debt\ndynamics. Gross financing needs are large, albeit manageable given the global reserve currency status\nof the U.S. dollar. A credible medium-term fiscal adjustment featuring reprioritization of budget\nprograms and revenue-gaining tax reform is needed to put public debt on a downward path.\nNonetheless, the risks of debt distress are low, and debt is viewed as sustainable.\n\n1\\. Background. An unprecedented level of fiscal expansion was introduced in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, leading to an increase in the fiscal deficit by over 8 percent of GDP. The\nsubsequent fiscal consolidations in 2021-22, as pandemic-related extraordinary measures were\nphased out, contributed to narrowing the budget deficit. However, the American Rescue Plan\n(enacted in March 2021), the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (enacted in November 2021),\nalong with the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act (both enacted in August 2022)\nslowed the pace of fiscal contraction, while weaker-than-expected income tax receipts widened\nfiscal deficits substantially.\n\n2\\.\nBaseline. The staff's baseline is based on current and likely-to-be-passed laws. Under this\nbaseline, public debt is expected to rise over the medium-term as age-related spending pressures\non entitlement programs assert themselves. Federal debt held by the public is projected to increase\nfrom about 97 percent of GDP in FY2023 to around 116 percent of GDP by 2033, with general\ngovernment gross debt rising from about 121 percent of GDP to 144 percent of GDP over the same\nperiod.\n\n3\\.\nAdjustment scenario. The general government primary deficit was 4.1 percent of GDP in\n2023 and is projected at 3.8 percent of GDP in 2024. Gradually raising the primary general\ngovernment surplus over the medium-term to around 1 percent of GDP (1.4 percent of GDP for the\nfederal government) would put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path. Staff views this\nadjustment as feasible. The target primary surplus would have to be larger to bring the debt ratio\ncloser to pre-Great Recession levels.\n\n4\\.\nDebt servicing costs. The debt projections have been adversely affected by the current and\nprojected deterioration in interest rate- growth differential, despite the safe-haven status of the\nUnited States. Under staff's baseline, the effective nominal interest rate is projected to stabilize at\n3.3 percent by 2033 after peaking at 4.0 percent in 2024. Government interest payments are\nexpected to rise with higher interest rates.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"47\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->",

Debt dynamics are driven mainly by persistent primary deficits and aging-related entitlement pressures, while higher interest costs from an adverse r–g (interest rate minus growth) profile raise debt service. Gross financing needs are large but judged manageable given the dollar’s reserve status and the debt’s domestic-law, local-currency profile and relatively long maturity stance.

Data collection from financial companies deemed \"covered reporters\" began in October 2019. This data collection requires the submission of information by central counterparties with average daily total open repo commitments of at least $50 billion. On May 6, 2024, the OFR promulgated a rule regarding \"Ongoing Data Collection of Non-centrally Cleared Bilateral Transactions in the U.S. Repurchase Agreement Market\" (part of 12 CFR 1610). Non-centrally cleared bilateral repo (NCCBR) transaction data is the last segment of repo data in the U.S. for which U.S. financial regulators have not had access to transaction-level data. This rule requires certain financial companies to report transaction-level NCCBR data on a daily basis. Companies that meet reporting thresholds have at least $10 billion in average daily total outstanding commitments to extend guarantees on and borrow cash through NCCBR transactions over all business days during the prior calendar quarter. Aggregated data from the cleared repo transaction OFR data collection, together with triparty repo data transaction data collected by the New York Federal Reserve Bank feed into the OFR's Short-Term Funding Monitor, which was launched in 2020.

To facilitate collaborative research, JADE offers scalable, high-performance computing with analytical software and support for programming languages such as R and Python in a cloud-based environment with analysis-ready data. The platform is extensible and will expand as new financial risks are identified and new data becomes available. Because it was identified as a data gap by FSOC, climate-related financial risk is the first use case FSOC identified for JADE. As a result, JADE has been designed with analytical capabilities broader than has been typical of past financial data analytical platforms.

In October 2023, the Board adopted a final regulation implementing the Building Block Approach capital requirement, and the regulation became effective on January 1, 2024. The United States-along with other interested jurisdictions-is developing an Aggregation Method at the IAIS. The NAIC adopted the Group Capital Calculation in 2020 and over half the states now require the GCC to be filed, with all states expected to adopt the GCC by January 1, 2026, when it becomes an Accreditation Standard. The IAIS has developed high-level principles and criteria to assess whether the Aggregation Method provides comparable outcomes to the ICS by the end of the monitoring period.

            "summary": "Annex IV reviews progress on prior Article IV and FSAP recommendations and presents a data-quality questionnaire. It documents clear progress on monetary and market-stability actions — notably the rapid policy-rate increases to about 5.25 percent by mid-2023, enhanced oversight and clearing in Treasury and repo markets, and stronger liquidity and reporting standards for money market funds — and on financial-stability infrastructure, including OFR data collections for repo markets, the Short-Term Funding Monitor, and the JADE analytical platform. Regulatory work has advanced too: the Basel III “endgame” proposals, MMF reforms, enhancements to Form PF reporting, and the Board and NAIC group-level capital approaches (Building Block Approach and Group Capital Calculation) have been implemented or are underway. Preparatory steps for CCP supervisory stress testing, increased CFTC resources, and higher scrutiny of new registrants are also recorded.\n\nAt the same time, the Annex highlights important shortfalls and outstanding legislative requirements. Many supply-side and fiscal recommendations (childcare/leave, tax reform, safety-net expansion, and durable steps to put debt-to-GDP on a declining path) show little or no implementation, though similar proposals appear in the president’s budget. Trade-policy recommendations have not been rolled back and domestic-content measures persist. Crisis-liquidity arrangements for systemic nonbanks and CCPs, certain foreign-currency liquidity tools, and some statutory changes (e.g., OLA extensions, greater independence for market regulators, and a full beneficial-ownership registry) remain unresolved. The data-quality assessment rates most macro statistics as adequate for surveillance but flags an important intersectoral inconsistency (saving–investment vs. the current account) and calls for better financial-sector granularity (CLO holdings, CRE loan breakdowns, and nonbank linkages).",

We broadly concur with staff's assessment of the U.S. economy, which has\nproven resilient and continues to see strong growth. We have seen a historic and equitable\neconomic recovery since the start of the Biden Administration, with an expanding labor force\nand low unemployment, rising business investment, and a significant decline in inflation. The\nFederal Reserve is adroitly managing the disinflation process. Moreover, the Administration has\nsupported the recovery by taking steps to safeguard financial stability and expand the economy's\nproductive capacity in a manner that is inclusive and environmentally sound. We believe that\nmaintaining prudent, forward-looking policies is the most effective way of supporting medium-\nto-long-term growth.\n\nAs staff note, the U.S. economy has turned in a remarkable performance over the past few\nyears, and the United States is the only G20 economy that is now operating above the levels\nof output and employment that were forecasted prior to the pandemic. The labor market\nremains healthy and is gradually easing toward stable and sustainable growth as labor supply and\ndemand realign. Carefully calibrated Federal Reserve monetary policy has seen inflation ease\nsignificantly since mid-2022, even with persistent economic growth and healthy labor markets.\nBusiness investment has grown rapidly, and we have had three record years of new business\napplications. We share staff's concerns about poverty and inequality but stress that we are\nwitnessing one of the most equitable economic recoveries in U.S. history, with large increases in\nBlack and Hispanic household wealth and disproportionate wage increases for low-income\nworkers. Although inflation remains higher than we would like, we expect rents and core\nservices inflation to further moderate over time, and we believe there is a path for further\ndisinflation while maintaining a healthy labor market. The U.S. banking sector remains sound\nand resilient, and banks have substantial capital to absorb losses and high levels of liquidity to\nmeet deposit outflows.\n\nLooking to the future, the Biden Administration is prioritizing historic investments aimed\nat boosting long-term productivity and addressing inequality. We are starting to reap the\nbenefits of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and CHIPS Act\nthrough increased investment in clean energy production, infrastructure, and manufacturing\nconstruction. Together, these key pieces of government legislation will increase competitiveness,\ntransform U.S. efforts to tackle climate change, and help to underpin long-term growth. For\ninstance, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $800 million in workforce development,\nthe CHIPS Act invests over $11 billion in Research and Development, and several of the IRA\nprovisions include bonus incentives for meeting prevailing wage and apprenticeship criteria. At\nthe same time, the Administration also remains committed to lowering costs for working families\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nand is working to bring down prescription drug costs, health insurance premiums, utility bills,\nand costs for everyday goods and services.",

Building on the Fund’s macro diagnostic (chapters 8–9) that highlighted resilient growth, disinflation, and strengthened market stability after pandemic-era shocks, the U.S. authorities emphasize a historic and equitable recovery: low unemployment, expanding labor force participation, robust business investment, and notable reductions in inflation driven by careful Federal Reserve policy. They reiterate that the banking sector remains well capitalized and liquid, aligning with the Fund’s findings on financial-sector resilience and recent monetary tightening to around mid-2023 policy rates.\n\nThe statement also connects the Fund’s sovereign risk and debt-sustainability work (Annex II) to U.S. fiscal plans: authorities concur with the assessment that sovereign stress is low and outline legislative and budgetary steps to preserve sustainability (bipartisan deficit reduction > $1 trillion and a proposed $3 trillion in ten-year savings). They stress a dual approach—maintain prudent fiscal and monetary stances while deploying large, targeted investments (Inflation Reduction Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS) to raise long-run productivity, support equitable growth, and meet climate and energy-security goals (DOE’s emissions projections and supply-chain initiatives). The statement flags political risks around debt-limit standoffs and shutdowns and underscores policy priorities to reduce poverty and lower costs for families, thus translating the Fund’s diagnostics into the Administration’s policy commitments.",

      "overall_summary": "This report is the IMF's comprehensive assessment of the U.S. economy following the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent policy responses. It synthesizes staff analysis, an executive board press release, annexes on risk and debt sustainability, and a U.S. Executive Director statement to tell a single narrative: the U.S. has recovered impressively from the pandemic shock but now faces important medium‑term tradeoffs and vulnerabilities. The near‑term story emphasizes unusually strong demand resilience—fueled by large, front‑loaded fiscal support, elevated household savings, and sharp housing and equity wealth gains—that supported consumption even as monetary policy tightened to counter a 2022 inflation shock.\n\nThe report's outlook translates that diagnosis into policy implications: growth is projected to remain solid in 2024 but slow sequentially toward potential by year‑end, and the unemployment rate is expected to edge up into 2025. Monetary policy faces a delicate choice across scenarios—disinflation could permit easing sooner if inflation expectations re‑anchor and demand is sensitive to rates, but if demand is rate‑insensitive or inflation remains persistent, policy must stay restrictive longer. A scenario box using the Fed’s FRBUS model maps plausible federal funds rate paths consistent with returning PCE inflation to 2 percent in 2025, highlighting parameter uncertainty (Phillips curve slope, expectations inertia, interest‑rate elasticity of demand).\n\nA central medium‑term concern is fiscal: pandemic-era measures, subsequent policy choices, weaker-than-expected revenue, and rising interest costs have produced a materially higher public debt trajectory. Under current policies general government debt is projected to rise for years (reaching historic highs in the staff baseline), creating a need for roughly a 4 percent of GDP adjustment over time to put debt clearly on a downward path—most likely through progressive tax increases, repricing and rebalancing of entitlement programs, and better fiscal institutions. The report stresses careful sequencing to limit macro drag (favoring offsetting revenue, phased entitlements adjustments, targeted social‑safety-net spending) and highlights the external and global spillovers of U.S. fiscal policy.\n\nComplementary chapters and annexes evaluate structural and distributional legacies (housing affordability, elevated corporate margins, child poverty reversal after pandemic supports ended), quantify sovereign risk and gross financing needs (annex II), assess the economic costs of trade restrictions (Section 301 tariffs), map global shock scenarios with policy responses (risk matrix), and review implementation progress on prior IMF recommendations and financial‑stability reforms. The Executive Director’s statement broadly concurs with the staff diagnosis while emphasizing the Administration’s policy priorities—productive investments, equitable recovery, and continued attention to fiscal sustainability—closing the loop between analysis and the U.S. authorities’ perspective.",

Building on the report’s earlier overview of the U.S. economy and policy context, it documents how very large, front‑loaded fiscal support in 2020–21, elevated household savings, and a pronounced rise in housing and equity prices together fueled robust consumption. At the same time, the chapter highlights important distributional and social costs: real incomes were temporarily compressed by the 2022 inflation spike, gains in wealth were concentrated at the top, and poverty—especially child poverty—increased after pandemic era supports expired. The staff show that housing wealth, and an increased elasticity of consumption to housing wealth (especially for homeowners without mortgages), accounted for much of the consumption rebound.",

Continued robust demand, ongoing supply side gains, and the carryover from the\nacceleration in activity in 2023H2 are expected to result in annualized growth of 2.6 percent\nin 2024. Despite these tailwinds, the economy is expected to slow in sequential terms, lowering the\n2024Q4/Q4 growth rate to close to the growth in potential output.

          "summary": "Building on Chapter 1’s diagnosis of pronounced demand‑side resilience and recent supply‑side improvements and policy responses, Chapter 2 translates those developments into a short‑term macro outlook and draws out the implications for monetary policy. The staff projects that strong demand, ongoing supply gains, and a significant carryover from the acceleration in activity in 2023H2 will produce an annualized growth rate of about 2.6 percent in 2024. However, that headline pace masks a sequential slowdown: by the end of 2024 (Q4/Q4) growth is expected to have moderated to a rate close to potential output. As the cyclical boost fades, the unemployment rate is projected to rise gradually to roughly 4.25 percent by mid‑2025.\n\nAgainst this backdrop the chapter emphasizes policy tradeoffs. The combination of moderating growth, improving supply capacity, and a gradually softening labor market should, other things equal, take pressure off inflation and alter the policy calculus facing the Federal Reserve. Policymakers must weigh persistent demand strengths and upside risks against the anticipated slowdown and rising unemployment when deciding whether to sustain, tighten, or begin to ease the currently restrictive stance. The chapter therefore frames monetary policy as needing to respond to sequential dynamics (the carryover effect and the move toward potential output) as much as to current high‑frequency indicators.",

Possible Paths for the Federal Funds Rate\n\nSimulations from the Fed's semi-structural FRBUS model show that a range of potential paths for the federal\nfunds rate would be consistent with PCE inflation returning to 2 percent during 2025. Optimal rate paths are\nderived based on:",
          "summary": "Building on Chapter 1’s diagnosis of strong demand‑side resilience and recent supply developments and Chapter 2’s short‑term macro outlook and monetary policy implications, this box uses the Fed’s semi‑structural FRBUS model to map out federal funds rate paths that bring PCE inflation back to 2 percent in 2025. The exercise computes “optimal” policy trajectories under alternative parameterizations of the model—specifically a much steeper Phillips curve, less sticky inflation expectations, and somewhat lower interest‑rate sensitivity of domestic demand—and compares those trajectories with the SEP median and different output‑gap policy rules. Across scenarios the model projects policy rates around the mid‑to‑high single digits in late‑2024, declining gradually through 2027, but the timing and front‑loading of cuts vary meaningfully with the assumed parameters.\n\nThe key result is intuitive but policy‑relevant: if inflation reacts more strongly to slack (a steeper Phillips curve) or if expectations re‑anchor more quickly (less inertia), disinflation proceeds faster and the Federal Reserve can reduce rates earlier and more front‑loaded. Conversely, if domestic demand is less responsive to higher rates, policy must remain restrictive for longer and rate cuts are deferred (first reductions pushed into H1 2025). The box therefore translates the diagnostic and outlook work in Chapters 1–2 into concrete policy‑path uncertainty, underscoring the importance of monitoring inflation expectations and demand sensitivity when setting the timing of rate easing.",

After the unprecedented fiscal response to the\nCOVID-19 outbreak, the budget deficit fell significantly in 2022 as pandemic-related fiscal measures\nunwound. However, the deficit rose again in 2023, driven by lower non-withheld income tax\nrevenues, higher interest costs, new outlays on student loan relief (the net present value of which is\nbooked in the current fiscal year), and increases in mandatory spending on income security. The\ncombined effect was a 3.5 percent of GDP\nwidening of the general government deficit in\nGeneral Government Gross Debt\n(percent of GDP)\n2023\\.

The steady upward path for the public debt-GDP ratio represents a growing risk to the\nU.S. and global economy, potentially feeding into higher fiscal financing costs and a growing\nrisk to the smooth rollover of maturing obligations. Based on standard IMF tools, the risk of\nsovereign stress in the U.S. is low, public debt is sustainable, and the government has some fiscal\nspace (Annex II). Nonetheless, under current policies, the general government debt-GDP ratio is\nexpected to exceed 140 percent of GDP by 2032 and the general government deficit is expected to\nremain around 21/2 percent of GDP above the levels forecast at the time of the 2019 Article IV\nconsultation. Such chronic fiscal deficits-stemming in large part from growing outlays on health\nand social security associated with an aging population-represent a significant and persistent\npolicy misalignment that needs to be urgently addressed.\n\n20\\.\nD. The large fiscal deficit is also putting upward pressure on the current account deficit.\nThe 2023 current account was 0.7 percent of GDP larger than the norm (Annex III) with almost all of\nthe difference being accounted for by a larger-than-desirable fiscal deficit. The impact of the fiscal\ndissaving on the external position in 2023 is, though, being partially offset by an increase in\ncorporate net saving arising from higher after-tax profits (see below) and a modest decline in\ncorporate investment as a share of GDP.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"20\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\n21\\.

Achieving the needed realignment of the fiscal position will require going beyond\nfinding efficiencies in discretionary, non-defense federal spending (which makes up only\n15 percent of total federal outlays). Instead, the burden of adjustment will need to be borne by\nprogressive increases in the federal tax burden and a rebalancing of entitlement programs (notably\nsocial security and Medicare). A range of policy options-some of which are already included in the\npresident's budget proposal-are outlined in Box 8. Putting these measures in place will, though,\nnecessitate taking difficult political decisions over the course of multiple years.\n\n23\\. Some of the fiscal savings from these efforts should be deployed to increase spending\non programs to alleviate poverty. This should include reinstating a more generous, fully\nrefundable Child Tax Credit and raising the income threshold for eligibility for the EITC for workers\nwithout children. These programs have already proven the important impact they can have on\npoverty outcomes-particularly for children-but they should be more carefully targeted to lower\nincome households. Expanding such social assistance would be particularly important if there were\nto be an increased reliance on indirect taxes.\n\n24\\. The proposed medium-term adjustment would be expected to have a relatively small\neffect on U.S. growth. If much of the adjustment can take place through higher indirect taxation,\naccompanied by improvements in the social safety net and gradual changes to entitlement\nprograms, the multipliers would be expected to be relatively small. Also, any drag to growth would\nbe partly offset by somewhat lower interest rates-from both a lower path for the policy rate and\nsmaller term premia-as well as a somewhat weaker dollar. By reducing fiscal vulnerabilities,\nlowering interest rates, and weakening the dollar, the adjustment would create positive outward\nspillovers, particularly for countries with sizable dollar financing needs.\n\n25\\. The upcoming expiration of provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides an\nopportunity to engage in a broader societal discussion about tax reform and the need for\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\nadditional sources of revenue. 11 Provisions such as the reduction in the top individual income tax\nrate (from 39.6 to 37 percent), the deduction of 20 percent of qualified business income for pass-\nthroughs (i.e., partnerships, sole proprietors and S-corporations), and the higher minimum threshold\nfor the estate and gift tax should all be allowed to expire as scheduled. However, the increase in the\nstandard deduction and limits on itemized deductions (for state and local taxes and mortgage\ninterest) should be maintained as a permanent feature of the personal income tax. This would\nincrease equity and simplify the tax code. Consideration could also be given to allowing for the\npermanent full expensing of a range of corporate capital spending. In the event that some of the\nrevenue-losing provisions are renewed, they should be offset with other measures that raise\nrevenues by a comparable amount.\n\n26\\. There should be an effort to address the shortcomings in fiscal institutions that\nperiodically lead to political stand-offs over the debt limit and the funding of the federal\ngovernment. These create systemic risks to the U.S. and global economy that are entirely avoidable.\nInstitutional changes should be designed to ensure that, once appropriations are approved, the\ncorresponding space is added automatically to the debt ceiling. Similarly, in situations where the\nfunding of federal agencies lapses because of an inability to approve appropriations, provisions\nshould be made to automatically fund the federal government at some fraction of previous year's\nfunding until a full-year appropriations bill can be signed into law.\n\n27\\. Authorities' views. Even with enactment of the CHIPS Act, the Infrastructure Investment\nand Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the administration has lowered the federal deficit by\nover US$1 trillion and has enacted policies to raise revenues including through sizable investments\nin modernizing the Internal Revenue Service, a minimum tax on the profits of the largest\ncorporations, and a surcharge on stock buybacks. The President's 2025 Budget has proposed\nmeasures to reduce the federal deficit by an average of around 1 percent of GDP over the next\ndecade, including by raising the corporate tax rate and increasing the tax burden for those earning\nover US$400,000 per year. The budget also made the case to make permanent an expanded\nrefundable Child Tax Credit and a more generous EITC for workers without dependents. While\npersistently higher long-term interest rates could create a challenge to debt sustainability, the\nadministration is committed to maintaining a credible and sustainable fiscal path that stabilizes the\nreal net interest burden as a share of GDP. The repeated bouts of debt limit standoffs and possible\ngovernment shutdowns represent an unnecessary economic headwind and have the potential to\nseriously harm business and consumer confidence.\n\n11 Staff's fiscal forecast assumes that these provisions will sunset as scheduled. If all of the expiring provisions of the\n2017 Act were to be renewed, this would add around 1.7 percent of GDP to the federal budget deficit (see\nCongressional Budget Office).\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"22\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->",
          "summary": "Chapter 4 builds directly on the macro diagnosis in Chapters 1–3 by turning attention from demand, supply, and monetary-policy dynamics to a mounting fiscal problem: a chronic and growing general government deficit and public debt trajectory that is materially above pre-pandemic forecasts. After pandemic relief faded, the deficit narrowed in 2022 but widened again in 2023 because of weaker non-withheld income tax receipts, higher interest costs, student‑loan relief accounting, and rising mandatory income‑security outlays. Under current policy settings, general government debt is projected to keep climbing—exceeding 140 percent of GDP by 2032—and deficits remain roughly 2½ percent of GDP above the 2019 Article IV baseline, representing a persistent policy misalignment driven largely by aging‑related entitlement spending.\n\nThe chapter quantifies the adjustment challenge (roughly a 4 percent of GDP fiscal tightening or a shift to a primary surplus near 1 percent of GDP to put debt on a clear downward path) and outlines policy routes and tradeoffs. Because discretionary non‑defense spending is only about 15 percent of outlays, the recommended burden of consolidation falls mainly on higher (progressive) taxes and rebalancing of entitlement programs (Social Security, Medicare), while preserving or expanding well‑targeted anti‑poverty measures (e.g., refundable Child Tax Credit, expanded EITC for childless workers). The chapter also stresses complementary measures: letting many 2017 tax provisions sunset to raise revenue, improving IRS capacity, fixing debt‑limit and continuing‑resolution mechanics to avoid destabilizing standoffs, and sequencing reforms to limit macro drag—favoring indirect taxation and phased changes to entitlements to lower multipliers and produce beneficial spillovers via lower interest rates and a weaker dollar.",

          "chapter_title": "IS THE U.S. ECONOMY BACK IN BALANCE?\n\n28\\. There has been an impressively rapid repair of the economy following the turmoil\ncaused by COVID-19. As the U.S. emerged from the pandemic there were important concerns\nabout the potential hysteresis effects arising from declines in labor force participation (particularly\namong women, older workers, and lower income households), the tragic loss of life and talent\nduring COVID, long-term health effects, widespread bankruptcies (particularly among smaller\nbusinesses), and education losses suffered by students. Now, with the benefit of time, it has become\nclear that the active deployment of a range of policies during the pandemic has allowed the U.S. to\navoid many of these possible downsides. This is also a testament to the flexibility, dynamism and\ninnovativeness of the U.S. economic model.\n\n29\\. It is difficult to be definitive about whether the U.S. economy is fully back in balance.\nAny assessment is complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which the pandemic\nmaterially changed the underlying steady state (e.g., relative to that which prevailed in 2018-19\nwhen the economy appeared to be close to potential, at full employment, with inflation close to\ntarget, and policy broadly at neutral settings). Also, a number of secular transitions-lower carbon\nintensity, greater penetration of digital technologies, different modalities of work, and an aging\npopulation-are underway.\n\n30\\. Nonetheless, a stock-taking of the various dimensions of this important question\nseems worthwhile as the pandemic moves into the rear-view mirror:\n\n· The signs of supply-demand imbalances in the labor market have mostly dissipated. Levels\nof hiring, quits, layoffs, unemployment, measures of labor underutilization (e.g., U6), and the\nlevel of job-to-job transitions have, in broad terms, returned to levels seen in 2018-19. The rate\nof employment growth remains very high (2.8 million jobs were created over the past 12\nmonths) but this appears to be consistent with recent sizeable inflows of foreign-born labor.\nWhile the job opening rate is modestly above pre-pandemic levels, structural changes in the\nhiring process (notably the increased recourse to electronic platforms) meant that the openings\nrate had an upward trend even prior to the pandemic. This would imply the economy will settle\nat a somewhat higher rate of job openings than prevailed in 2019. Finally, nominal wage growth\nremains above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation. However, due to strong productivity,\nthe recent growth in unit labor costs has actually been at lower rates that were seen in 2018-19.\nFurthermore, the post-pandemic increase in corporate margins (see below) suggests that there\nis space for real wages and the labor share of income to rise without an increase in inflation.\n\n. The share of consumption accounted for by goods remains above pre-pandemic levels. The\npandemic triggered a marked shift in consumer demand from services to goods that has\nsubsequently reversed. However, even prior to 2020 there was an ongoing increase in the\nrelative share of goods in consumption-particularly durables-driven by rising incomes and a\nsecular decline in the relative price of goods versus services. After accounting for this prior trend,\nit appears that the swing back from goods to services consumption is largely complete.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"24\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\n\n<!-- FigureContent=\"**Title**: J2J Flow and Unemployment Rate\n**ChartType**: line\n**TopicKeywords**: Business and finance, Economics, Employment\n**DetailedDescription**: The chart displays two lines representing the unemployment rate and J2J transitions from 2010 Q1 to 2022 Q1.

The external position is broadly in line with the level implied by medium-term\nfundamentals and desirable policies (Annex III). While the current account deficit (at 3 percent\nof GDP in 2023) is somewhat above the norm, this is largely due to the effects of a larger-than-\ndesirable fiscal position. Similarly, while the U.S. dollar is around 10 percent above its pre-\npandemic levels, these gains can largely be accounted for by the strong cyclical position of the\nU.S. and improvements in the terms of trade (as the U.S. has become a net energy exporter). A\nmedium-term fiscal consolidation-undertaken by both the U.S. and its trading partners-would\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"25\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\nbe expected to bring the current account even closer to its medium-term norm and modestly\nweaken the dollar.\n\n. The real policy rate is well above neutral. With inflationary pressures remaining a concern, it\nis appropriate for the ex ante real federal funds rate to be above estimates of the neutral policy\nrate (although there is significant uncertainty about what the neutral rate will be once inflation is\ndecisively back at 2 percent). However, it is expected that the gap between the policy rate and\nestimates of neutral will diminish in the coming months as inflation falls back to 2 percent.\n\n· Corporate margins rose markedly during\nthe pandemic.

If that proves to be true, in the coming years we should expect to see\na decline in rates of home ownership (and increase in rentals), slower rates of household\nformation, and a shift of demand toward smaller homes. Younger and lower-income households\nwould be most affected by these trends.\n\n. The public debt and deficit, as a share of GDP, are larger than prior to the pandemic. The\ngeneral government deficit is expected, over the medium-term, to remain around 21/2 percent of\nGDP higher than prior to the pandemic (split evenly between higher interest payments and a\nlooser primary balance). The public debt-GDP ratio is also well above levels expected just a few\nyears ago. This worsening of the fiscal position is perhaps the most visible and lasting imbalance\ncaused by the various policies undertaken during the pandemic. When combined with a likely\nincrease in financing costs (e.g., relative to the very low interest rates of the 2010's), the upward\nshift in debt and deficits is particularly troubling. As discussed above, developing a clear strategy\nfor reducing the debt and deficit over time will be essential. Such an adjustment would likely\nlead to lower interest rates, a weaker currency, and a CA deficit that is closer to the medium-\nterm norm.\n\n31\\. All in all, the evidence suggests the U.S. economy has largely returned to balance.\n\nMany of the imbalances that were catalyzed by the pandemic have unwound (notably with respect\nto labor markets, the composition of consumption, and the external position). Inflation is expected\nto soon return to target which will subsequently allow the monetary stance to normalize. There is\nsignificant uncertainty surrounding the prospects for corporate profitability and the relative price of\nhousing. However, the fiscal deficit remains much too large and will require decisive policy efforts to\naddress (see above). Addressing this fiscal imbalance through higher indirect taxes, increased\ntaxation of high-income individuals, eliminating poorly targeted tax expenditures, and making\ngradual parametric changes to entitlement programs should be expected to have relatively small\nmultiplier effects. However, such a change in the policy mix would allow for lower public debt-GDP,\na smaller CA deficit, and would put downward pressure on market interest rates. As such, it would\nlessen macroeconomic vulnerabilities and create positive outward spillovers (particularly to those\nwith sizable dollar financing needs).\n\n2\\. Authorities' views. Significant progress had been made in returning the economy to\nbalance after the extraordinary shocks experienced with the pandemic and the Russian invasion of\nUkraine. Based on a range of indicators, labor supply and demand had come into better balance\nover the past year. Supply chain disruptions had been largely resolved. Inflation is on a downward\npath and is expected to soon return to more normal levels. The child tax credit contained in the\nadministration's budget proposal, if enacted, would be an impactful tool to reduce poverty. Finally,\nsupply side reforms, including those legislated in the Inflation Reduction Act, Infrastructure,\n\n12 Estimates from the Federal Home Finance Agency point to lock-in effects leading to a 57 percent reduction in\nhome sales in 2023Q4 which reduced activity, created constraints on mobility, and boosted housing prices.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 27\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->\n\nInvestment, and Jobs Act, and CHIPS Act, are working to relieve bottlenecks, increase labor\nproductivity, and address climate challenges.

          "summary": "Chapter 5 takes stock of whether the U.S. economy has returned to a balanced, pre‑pandemic steady state. Building on the diagnostic lens of Chapter 1 (demand resilience and recent supply improvements) and the short‑term macro and policy framing of Chapters 2–3, the chapter concludes that many pandemic‑related imbalances have largely unwound. Labor market indicators (hiring, quits, layoffs, unemployment, U6, and job‑to‑job flows) have broadly returned to 2018–19 levels, consumption patterns have shifted back toward services after the goods spike, and poverty has reverted to roughly pre‑pandemic rates following the expiration of pandemic supports. Inflation is on a downward path, which should allow monetary policy to normalize as the ex‑ante real federal funds rate moves back toward neutral. The external position is broadly consistent with medium‑term fundamentals, with the current account modestly wide largely because of the larger fiscal deficit.\n\nAt the same time, the chapter highlights important persistent and emerging imbalances. Corporate profit margins have risen markedly and may or may not retrace to pre‑pandemic norms, implying distributional and inflationary considerations. Housing affordability remains a major and potentially long‑lasting imbalance — prices are roughly 50 percent higher than before the pandemic, inventory and turnover are low, and lock‑in effects from low fixed‑rate mortgages constrain mobility. The public debt‑to‑GDP ratio and structural deficit are materially higher than pre‑pandemic forecasts, posing a medium‑term vulnerability that would benefit from a credible fiscal consolidation (with attendant effects on interest rates, the dollar, and the current account). Financial stability risks have moderated since the 2023 Article IV review, but pockets of vulnerability remain — especially office CRE exposure concentrated in smaller and regional banks, nonbank mortgage servicing resilience, and concentration of uninsured deposits. The chapter also describes recent Treasury‑market resilience reforms and flags growing trade and industrial policy distortions (tariffs, domestic content subsidies, export controls) as a downside risk to both U.S. and global growth.",

          "chapter_title": "Box 11. Impact of U.S. Tariffs\n\nIn May 2024, the U.S. announced recommendations to maintain Section 301 tariffs that were initially\nimposed on China in 2018 and 2019, and to add or increase tariffs for certain products. Evidence on the\nimpact of these measures shows that tariffs reconfigured supply chains, raised import prices and, overall,\nhad modest negative effects on the U.S. economy.\n\nU.S. firms and importers bore the brunt of the tariffs imposed on imports from China through a one-for-one\nincrease in import prices.1 However, the pass-through to retail prices was small with costs apparently\nabsorbed in corporate margins.\n\nOn balance, increased trade restrictions had a negative effect on U.S. welfare. The tariffs negatively impacted\nsectors that were exposed to the tariffs (e.g., through imported inputs), reducing export growth (Handley,\nKamal, and Monarch, 2020) and lowering employment in those sectors (Flaaen and Pierce 2019). Overall,\nthere was an estimated negative effect on U.S. welfare equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP (Fajgelbaum and\nKhandelwal, 2022). Similarly, Boer and Rieth (2024) argue that reversing the 2018-19 tariffs would raise\noutput by 0.4 percent after three years.\n\nThe tariffs have prompted a reconfiguration of supply chains, although links to China remain strong. U.S.\nimports from China dropped in sectors exposed to the tariffs, replaced by imports from other countries\n(particularly in strategic sectors). However, this may not have reduced reliance on China in U.S. supply chains\nas those countries that increased their exports to the U.S., on average, imported more from China (Freund et\nal, 2023). Gopinath et al (2024) highlights the emergence of connector countries where greater Chinese\npresence-measured either through exports or announced greenfield investments-has been correlated\nwith higher exports from that country to the U.S.\n\nRetaliation by China amplified the negative impact of the U.S. policies. In response to the 2018-19 tariffs,\nChina introduced its own restrictions on imports from the U.S., raising tariffs to around 21 percent on almost\n60 percent of imports from the U.S. These retaliatory tariffs reduced U.S. employment (Waugh, 2019).\nCaceres et al. (2019) assess that a 25 percent uniform tariff on Chinese imports, that is reciprocated by China,\nwould reduce U.S. output by 0.2 percent.\n\n1 See Amiti, Redding, and Weinstein (2019), Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy, and Khandelwal (2020); Cavallo, Gopinath,\nNeiman, and Tang, 2021; Flaaen, Hortacsu, and Tintelnot (2020), USITC (2023).",
          "summary": "This box evaluates the economic impact of U.S. tariffs on China (Section 301 measures from 2018–19 and related 2024 recommendations to maintain or expand them). Empirical evidence shows the tariffs raised import costs for U.S. firms and importers roughly one-for-one, but only minimally passed through to consumer retail prices; instead, firms absorbed much of the cost in margins. The measures prompted significant reconfiguration of supply chains: U.S. imports from China fell in tariff-exposed sectors and were partly replaced by other exporters, but those substitute suppliers often increased their own links to China (the emergence of “connector” countries), meaning dependence on Chinese inputs did not disappear. Overall macro effects were modestly negative — reducing output and employment in exposed sectors, dampening export growth, and lowering welfare in estimates ranging from a welfare loss of about 0.1 percent of GDP to a potential 0.4 percent output gain from reversing the tariffs after a few years.",

          "chapter_title": "Annex II. Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability Assessment\n\nFollowing the unprecedented fiscal response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the budget deficit returned to\npre-pandemic levels in 2022, only to be reversed in 2023 mainly due to lower income tax revenue and\nincreasing interest rates. Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to rise as a share of GDP\nover the medium-term as aging-related expenditures on health and social security feed into the debt\ndynamics. Gross financing needs are large, albeit manageable given the global reserve currency status\nof the U.S. dollar. A credible medium-term fiscal adjustment featuring reprioritization of budget\nprograms and revenue-gaining tax reform is needed to put public debt on a downward path.\nNonetheless, the risks of debt distress are low, and debt is viewed as sustainable.\n\n1\\. Background. An unprecedented level of fiscal expansion was introduced in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, leading to an increase in the fiscal deficit by over 8 percent of GDP. The\nsubsequent fiscal consolidations in 2021-22, as pandemic-related extraordinary measures were\nphased out, contributed to narrowing the budget deficit. However, the American Rescue Plan\n(enacted in March 2021), the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (enacted in November 2021),\nalong with the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act (both enacted in August 2022)\nslowed the pace of fiscal contraction, while weaker-than-expected income tax receipts widened\nfiscal deficits substantially.\n\n2\\.\nBaseline. The staff's baseline is based on current and likely-to-be-passed laws. Under this\nbaseline, public debt is expected to rise over the medium-term as age-related spending pressures\non entitlement programs assert themselves. Federal debt held by the public is projected to increase\nfrom about 97 percent of GDP in FY2023 to around 116 percent of GDP by 2033, with general\ngovernment gross debt rising from about 121 percent of GDP to 144 percent of GDP over the same\nperiod.\n\n3\\.\nAdjustment scenario. The general government primary deficit was 4.1 percent of GDP in\n2023 and is projected at 3.8 percent of GDP in 2024. Gradually raising the primary general\ngovernment surplus over the medium-term to around 1 percent of GDP (1.4 percent of GDP for the\nfederal government) would put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path. Staff views this\nadjustment as feasible. The target primary surplus would have to be larger to bring the debt ratio\ncloser to pre-Great Recession levels.\n\n4\\.\nDebt servicing costs. The debt projections have been adversely affected by the current and\nprojected deterioration in interest rate- growth differential, despite the safe-haven status of the\nUnited States. Under staff's baseline, the effective nominal interest rate is projected to stabilize at\n3.3 percent by 2033 after peaking at 4.0 percent in 2024. Government interest payments are\nexpected to rise with higher interest rates.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"47\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"UNITED STATES\" -->",

Following the large, pandemic-era fiscal expansion and partial consolidation, the staff baseline projects public debt ratios to rise over the medium term (federal debt held by the public from ~97% of GDP in FY2023 to ~116% by 2033; general government gross debt from ~121% to ~144% by 2033). Debt dynamics are driven mainly by persistent primary deficits and aging-related entitlement pressures, while higher interest costs from an adverse r–g (interest rate minus growth) profile raise debt service. Gross financing needs are large but judged manageable given the dollar’s reserve status and the debt’s domestic-law, local-currency profile and relatively long maturity stance. Stress modules and fan charts point to a moderate overall risk: the Debt Fanchart flags a marginally high risk because debt does not stabilize under the baseline, while the Gross Financing Needs (GFN) financeability module signals moderate risk.",

This data collection requires the submission of information by central counterparties with average daily total open repo commitments of at least $50 billion. On May 6, 2024, the OFR promulgated a rule regarding \"Ongoing Data Collection of Non-centrally Cleared Bilateral Transactions in the U.S. Repurchase Agreement Market\" (part of 12 CFR 1610). Non-centrally cleared bilateral repo (NCCBR) transaction data is the last segment of repo data in the U.S. for which U.S. financial regulators have not had access to transaction-level data. This rule requires certain financial companies to report transaction-level NCCBR data on a daily basis. Companies that meet reporting thresholds have at least $10 billion in average daily total outstanding commitments to extend guarantees on and borrow cash through NCCBR transactions over all business days during the prior calendar quarter. Aggregated data from the cleared repo transaction OFR data collection, together with triparty repo data transaction data collected by the New York Federal Reserve Bank feed into the OFR's Short-Term Funding Monitor, which was launched in 2020.

Following completion of an analysis of the MWCBs' operations, the SROs' MWCB rules were made permanent in March and April 2022 without modification to how they operate. The SROs, however, added requirements relating to testing of the MWCBs and identification of circumstances (e.g., a market decline that falls just short of triggering a MWCB) that warrant review by the SROs and reports to the SEC. See, e.g., https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyse/2022/34-94441.pdf. Delivery of the Consolidated Audit Trail. The SEC charged the SROs with developing and building a Consolidated Audit Trail.

          "summary": "Annex IV reviews progress on prior Article IV and FSAP recommendations and presents a data-quality questionnaire. It documents clear progress on monetary and market-stability actions — notably the rapid policy-rate increases to about 5.25 percent by mid-2023, enhanced oversight and clearing in Treasury and repo markets, and stronger liquidity and reporting standards for money market funds — and on financial-stability infrastructure, including OFR data collections for repo markets, the Short-Term Funding Monitor, and the JADE analytical platform. Regulatory work has advanced too: the Basel III “endgame” proposals, MMF reforms, enhancements to Form PF reporting, and the Board and NAIC group-level capital approaches (Building Block Approach and Group Capital Calculation) have been implemented or are underway. Preparatory steps for CCP supervisory stress testing, increased CFTC resources, and higher scrutiny of new registrants are also recorded.\n\nAt the same time, the Annex highlights important shortfalls and outstanding legislative requirements. Many supply-side and fiscal recommendations (childcare/leave, tax reform, safety-net expansion, and durable steps to put debt-to-GDP on a declining path) show little or no implementation, though similar proposals appear in the president’s budget. Trade-policy recommendations have not been rolled back and domestic-content measures persist. Crisis-liquidity arrangements for systemic nonbanks and CCPs, certain foreign-currency liquidity tools, and some statutory changes (e.g., OLA extensions, greater independence for market regulators, and a full beneficial-ownership registry) remain unresolved. The data-quality assessment rates most macro statistics as adequate for surveillance but flags an important intersectoral inconsistency (saving–investment vs. the current account) and calls for better financial-sector granularity (CLO holdings, CRE loan breakdowns, and nonbank linkages).",

We broadly concur with staff's assessment of the U.S. economy, which has\nproven resilient and continues to see strong growth. We have seen a historic and equitable\neconomic recovery since the start of the Biden Administration, with an expanding labor force\nand low unemployment, rising business investment, and a significant decline in inflation. The\nFederal Reserve is adroitly managing the disinflation process. Moreover, the Administration has\nsupported the recovery by taking steps to safeguard financial stability and expand the economy's\nproductive capacity in a manner that is inclusive and environmentally sound. We believe that\nmaintaining prudent, forward-looking policies is the most effective way of supporting medium-\nto-long-term growth.\n\nAs staff note, the U.S. economy has turned in a remarkable performance over the past few\nyears, and the United States is the only G20 economy that is now operating above the levels\nof output and employment that were forecasted prior to the pandemic. The labor market\nremains healthy and is gradually easing toward stable and sustainable growth as labor supply and\ndemand realign. Carefully calibrated Federal Reserve monetary policy has seen inflation ease\nsignificantly since mid-2022, even with persistent economic growth and healthy labor markets.\nBusiness investment has grown rapidly, and we have had three record years of new business\napplications. We share staff's concerns about poverty and inequality but stress that we are\nwitnessing one of the most equitable economic recoveries in U.S. history, with large increases in\nBlack and Hispanic household wealth and disproportionate wage increases for low-income\nworkers. Although inflation remains higher than we would like, we expect rents and core\nservices inflation to further moderate over time, and we believe there is a path for further\ndisinflation while maintaining a healthy labor market. The U.S. banking sector remains sound\nand resilient, and banks have substantial capital to absorb losses and high levels of liquidity to\nmeet deposit outflows.\n\nLooking to the future, the Biden Administration is prioritizing historic investments aimed\nat boosting long-term productivity and addressing inequality. We are starting to reap the\nbenefits of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and CHIPS Act\nthrough increased investment in clean energy production, infrastructure, and manufacturing\nconstruction. Together, these key pieces of government legislation will increase competitiveness,\ntransform U.S. efforts to tackle climate change, and help to underpin long-term growth. For\ninstance, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $800 million in workforce development,\nthe CHIPS Act invests over $11 billion in Research and Development, and several of the IRA\nprovisions include bonus incentives for meeting prevailing wage and apprenticeship criteria. At\nthe same time, the Administration also remains committed to lowering costs for working families\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nand is working to bring down prescription drug costs, health insurance premiums, utility bills,\nand costs for everyday goods and services.",
          "summary": "This statement by the U.S. Executive Director and advisors affirms broad concurrence with the IMF staff’s upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy documented in prior chapters. Building on the Fund’s macro diagnostic (chapters 8–9) that highlighted resilient growth, disinflation, and strengthened market stability after pandemic-era shocks, the U.S. authorities emphasize a historic and equitable recovery: low unemployment, expanding labor force participation, robust business investment, and notable reductions in inflation driven by careful Federal Reserve policy. They reiterate that the banking sector remains well capitalized and liquid, aligning with the Fund’s findings on financial-sector resilience and recent monetary tightening to around mid-2023 policy rates.\n\nThe statement also connects the Fund’s sovereign risk and debt-sustainability work (Annex II) to U.S. fiscal plans: authorities concur with the assessment that sovereign stress is low and outline legislative and budgetary steps to preserve sustainability (bipartisan deficit reduction > $1 trillion and a proposed $3 trillion in ten-year savings). They stress a dual approach—maintain prudent fiscal and monetary stances while deploying large, targeted investments (Inflation Reduction Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS) to raise long-run productivity, support equitable growth, and meet climate and energy-security goals (DOE’s emissions projections and supply-chain initiatives). The statement flags political risks around debt-limit standoffs and shutdowns and underscores policy priorities to reduce poverty and lower costs for families, thus translating the Fund’s diagnostics into the Administration’s policy commitments.",
