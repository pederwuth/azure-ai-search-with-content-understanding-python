        "overall_summary": "This book presents a practical, working framework for representing the contents of document pages as structured, semantically rich objects. It opens by motivating the need to bridge visual rendering and machine-readable semantics—so a chart or table is not only displayable but also searchable, describable for accessibility, and reproducible as data. The Page Objects approach decomposes a page into named object types (text blocks, tables, figures and so on) and defines the responsibilities and metadata each object carries.\n\nA central thread through the book is the figure page object, used as a running example to show how UI-facing markup and underlying metadata coexist. The figure example demonstrates a human-readable caption and a parallel set of metadata fields (Title, ChartType, TopicKeywords, DetailedDescription, Summary, MarkdownDataTable, AxisTitles, FootnotesAndAnnotations). Readers learn how these fields map to visual properties—chart type determines geometry, the data table supplies numeric series, axis titles provide semantic labels, and annotations or footnotes add contextual nuance.\n\nBeyond the mechanics of any single object, the book explains how such structured representations enable multiple downstream benefits: improved accessibility (through detailed descriptions and summaries), reliable search and indexing (through topic keywords and semantic labels), reproducible analytics (via embedded data tables), and programmatic rendering or transformation across platforms. Practical examples show interpreting chart data (e.g., peaks and troughs in monthly values), how color or labeling communicates categories, and how to include annotations that preserve editorial context.\n\nThe latter sections shift from examples to implementation guidance and best practices—schema design choices, how to balance human-friendly captions with machine-oriented descriptions, workflows for extracting and authoring metadata, and recommendations for integrating Page Objects into publishing pipelines, document ingestion systems, and accessibility workflows. The book closes by presenting case studies and forward-looking advice for extending the framework to new object types and evolving downstream needs.",

The chapter demonstrates how a figure is represented for both rendering and semantic understanding: a caption for display, a detailed description for accessibility and search, and a structured data table for reproducible plotting or data extraction.\n\nBuilding on the foundation of object types and their roles in composing a page, the chapter highlights how figure metadata maps directly to visual properties—chart type determines geometry (bar), the data table provides the numeric series (monthly values Jan–Jun), axis titles label the dimensions (Months, Values), and color assignments communicate categorical distinctions. The included example illustrates interpretation of the data (a peak in April at 450 and a low in January at 200) and shows how annotations and footnotes can provide context.
