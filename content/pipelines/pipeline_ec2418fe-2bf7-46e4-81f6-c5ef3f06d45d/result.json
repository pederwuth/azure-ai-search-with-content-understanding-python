        "overall_summary": "This book presents a comprehensive approach to modeling the components of digital documents as explicit, structured page objects so that both humans and machines can read, interpret, and act on document content. It frames figures — charts, tables, and images — not as opaque pixels but as layered objects that carry a graphic, a caption, a data table, raw values, and encoding metadata (color, axis titles, labels). The opening material demonstrates these ideas concretely with a bar chart of monthly values (Jan: 200, Feb: 300, Mar: 400, Apr: 450, May: 350, Jun: 250) and shows how caption text, axis labels, a Markdown data table, color encodings, and a textual value listing together create a single, machine-readable Figure object.\n\nFrom that concrete example the narrative expands to the design principles that make page objects useful: consistent axis labels, explicit metadata, alternate data representations, and standardized annotations that support accessibility, reproducibility, and automated extraction. The book explains how encoding choices (for example, coloring January and April orange, February and May green, and March and June blue) and redundant representations (graphic + table + raw numbers) reduce ambiguity and enable multiple consumption modes, from visual interpretation to programmatic ingestion. It highlights practical interpretation of the example dataset — the series peaks in April (450) and is lowest in January (200), with local highs in March (400) and May (350) — to show how structured figures aid analysis.\n\nLater chapters build workflows and tooling around the page object model: how to annotate figures, attach metadata, and convert visual elements into standardized, interoperable schemas that downstream systems can index, search, and analyze. The book also addresses quality signals and validation — what makes an axis title “clear,” how to verify that a caption matches the underlying data table, and how to encode provenance so the figure is reproducible. Practical guidance includes best practices for authoring, annotating, and extracting figure content in ways that support accessibility (e.g., screen readers), machine learning pipelines, and long-term digital preservation.\n\nFinally, the book situates the page object model within broader document engineering work: integrating with metadata standards, building automated extraction pipelines, and designing annotation interfaces for human-in-the-loop curation. It closes with case studies and recommendations for adopting the model in real projects — from research publishing to enterprise document management — showing how modest authoring and annotation practices unlock large gains in discoverability, interoperability, and automated analysis.",
