The opening sections motivate the approach with problems in extraction, reproducibility, and automated reporting that arise when visual content lacks standardized, machine-readable descriptions.\n\nAfter establishing the need for a new document model, the book builds the foundation of the page-object approach. It defines a minimal, extensible structure for page objects, explains how visual data (charts, tables, images) should be represented, and covers best practices for labels, axis titles, captions and data serialization. The book also introduces principles of visual data representation so that metadata aligns with how humans read and interpret charts.\n\nA concrete, central example — a Figure page object encapsulating a bar chart — ties the ideas together. The example includes a human caption (\"Figure 1: Here is a figure with text\"), structured metadata (chart type, topic keywords, detailed description), a Markdown data table, and axis titles. Using monthly values (Jan–Jun: 200, 300, 400, 450, 350, 250), the example demonstrates how the figure encodes a rising trend through April and a decline into June, and shows how axis titles and a tabular data payload make interpretation and automatic extraction straightforward.\n\nThe final sections translate the conceptual model into practical workflows: extracting page objects from documents, annotating and validating metadata, integrating page objects into analytics pipelines, and using them for automated reporting and downstream tasks such as trend detection, annotation and compliance checks. Throughout, the book emphasizes reproducible, interoperable document design that bridges the needs of human readers and automated systems.",
