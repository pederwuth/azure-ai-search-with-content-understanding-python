        "overall_summary": "This book tells a practical and systematic story about turning visual artifacts in documents—figures, charts, tables—into well-modeled, machine-actionable objects. It begins with foundational ideas about document structure and object modeling, introducing a page-object approach that treats visual elements as first-class data-bearing entities rather than opaque images. From that foundation the book moves into concrete exemplars, showing exactly how a Figure object can encapsulate not only a rendered bar chart but the structured metadata that makes that chart reproducible, searchable, and analyzable.\n\nEarly chapters ground readers in the anatomy of a Figure object: captions, axis titles, data tables, descriptive metadata and annotations. Using a worked example (a bar chart of monthly values from January to June), the book demonstrates how fields like ChartType, TopicKeywords, DetailedDescription, MarkdownDataTable, AxisTitles, and FootnotesAndAnnotations map to the visual presentation. The example makes explicit how the underlying numeric table reveals patterns—values rising to a peak in April (450) then falling to June (250), and a trough in January (200)—illustrating how metadata supports objective interpretation of visuals.\n\nAs the book progresses it shows how these representations enable downstream capabilities: automated extraction of figure data, improved accessibility through explicit text and structured tables, reproducible analytics pipelines, and richer search and archival functionality. Chapters integrate technical guidance with examples and best practices so readers can consistently produce figures that are both human-readable and machine-actionable.\n\nThroughout, the narrative emphasizes interoperability between semantic metadata and visual content. The work culminates in practical workflows and tools for embedding structured metadata into documents, extracting it for analytics, and using it to support accessibility, auditing, and reuse. The reader finishes not only understanding the concepts but with clear patterns to apply them across publishing, data visualization, and document engineering contexts.",

By exposing the underlying numeric table and explicit axis labels, the chapter shows how a visual asset can be represented in a reproducible, analyzable form.
