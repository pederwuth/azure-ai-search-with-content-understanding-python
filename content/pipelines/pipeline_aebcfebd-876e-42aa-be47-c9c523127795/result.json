        "overall_summary": "This book tells the story of how modern document understanding systems move from low-level page layout to high-value structured content by modeling page objects, with a detailed deep-dive on Figures. It begins by establishing core concepts of page layout and object modeling — how pages are decomposed into text blocks, images, tables, and figures — and why an object-centric approach enables consistent extraction, indexing, and downstream analysis. Early chapters introduce the vocabulary and representations needed to reason about visual and semantic information together.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, the book drills into the concrete example of the Figure as a page object type. Using a bar chart of monthly values (Jan: 200, Feb: 300, Mar: 400, Apr: 450, May: 350, Jun: 250), it explains both the visible visual elements and the embedded metadata (caption: \"Figure 1: Here is a figure with text\", axis labels: \"Months\" and \"Values\", and an explicit data table and summary). The example is used to teach how to parse bars, align them with axis ticks, reconcile numeric labels with a metadata table, and extract key insights such as the highest (April = 450) and lowest (January = 200) points.\n\nSubsequent sections translate the example into practical processing guidance: how to detect and classify figures on a page, how to extract and normalize axis labels and numeric data, methods for aligning visual marks to tabular metadata, and strategies for resolving inconsistencies when visual and textual cues disagree. The book also addresses implementation concerns such as OCR limits, graphical noise, semantic labeling, and the importance of capturing both visible content and embedded descriptive metadata for robust downstream use.\n\nFinally, the book situates these techniques within real-world workflows: building pipelines that convert visual documents into structured datasets, improving accessibility through explicit captions and labels, supporting search and analytics with extracted numeric series, and evaluating extraction quality. Throughout, practical examples, heuristics, and best-practice patterns are emphasized so readers can move from theory to applied systems that reliably interpret figures and other page objects.",
