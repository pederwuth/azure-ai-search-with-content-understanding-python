  "overall_summary": "This book tells the story of how web pages can be designed as collections of semantically rich, machine‑friendly page objects so that visual content is both human‑accessible and programmatically useful. It begins with foundational material on the document object model and basic page composition, then introduces a layered page‑object approach that treats figures, tables, captions and annotations as first‑class structured elements. Using concrete examples, the book shows how each page object bundles visual content, descriptive metadata, and structured data so that charts and images carry the information needed by readers, search engines, assistive technologies and downstream tools.\n\nA central case study—developed in the chapter summarized here—focuses on the Figure page object. The chapter walks through a monthly‑values bar chart (January–June) and demonstrates how visual bars, axis titles, a figcaption, a Markdown data table, and machine‑readable metadata (chart type, topical keywords, detailed description, a short analytic summary and explicit color encodings) should be co‑authored. That concrete example illustrates best practices: axis labeling (x = Months, y = Values), a data table matching the visual, color mappings to indicate groupings (January & April = orange; February & May = green; March & June = blue), footnotes/annotations and a short summary noting the April peak (450) and January low (200).\n\nBeyond encoding techniques, the book makes the case for designing figures and other objects to enable reuse, automated analysis and accessibility. It explains why explicit metadata, structured tables and consistent labeling reduce ambiguity, improve discoverability, and support assistive technologies and programmatic consumers. Later sections and chapters extend these ideas into schema recommendations, implementation patterns, tool support and organizational workflows so that page objects become repeatable production artifacts rather than ad‑hoc decorations.\n\nTaken together, the book is both prescriptive and practical: it gives a conceptual framework for thinking about page objects, shows how that framework maps to real documents and visualizations, and supplies patterns and checklists for authors, designers and engineers to produce content that people and machines can read, interpret and repurpose.",

      "summary": "This chapter drills into the Page Objects layer by focusing on the Figure object (section 2.2), building directly on earlier chapters that introduced the document object model and basic page composition. It demonstrates how a figure bundles visual content, descriptive metadata and structured data: a bar chart is paired with a figcaption, axis titles, a Markdown data table and machine-friendly metadata describing chart type, topical keywords, detailed description, a short summary and color encoding. The chapter uses a concrete monthly-values example (January–June) to show how numeric data, color mappings and textual summaries are represented together so both humans and tools can interpret the visual.\n\nBeyond specifying content, the chapter highlights how figure metadata and markup support usability and downstream processing. It emphasizes axis labeling (x = Months, y = Values), an explicit data table that matches the visual bars, color assignments that group months (January & April = orange; February & May = green; March & June = blue), and a short analytic summary noting the April peak (450) and January low (200). This ties the abstract page-object concepts from earlier chapters to concrete practices for encoding charts, captions and annotations so figures are accessible, machine-readable and semantically rich.",
