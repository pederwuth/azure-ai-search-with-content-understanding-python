        "overall_summary": "This book tells the story of how to convert free‑form documents into consistently structured, machine‑actionable page objects. It begins by motivating the need for a page object model: documents are rich, varied, and semantically dense, and organizing them into predictable, well‑defined objects (headers, paragraphs, tables, figures, etc.) makes them easier to interpret, index, and process. The opening chapters introduce the core ideas of document decomposition, the role of semantic elements, and why consistent metadata matters for both human readers and downstream systems.\n\nAfter establishing the foundations, the book walks through each page object type in detail. Early chapters define the responsibilities and expected metadata for headers and paragraphs; subsequent chapters cover tables and other tabular representations; and the featured Chapter 2.2 drills into the Figure page object. Each object chapter pairs human‑visible presentation (captions, labels, visual encodings) with the machine‑readable attributes required to make that presentation robustly interpretable—Title, ChartType, TopicKeywords, DetailedDescription, AxisTitles, MarkdownDataTable, and footnotes are example attributes shown in practice.\n\nChapter 2.2 uses a concrete bar chart example (monthly values January–June: 200, 300, 400, 450, 350, 250) to demonstrate how caption, plotted values, and embedded metadata cooperate. The narrative shows how axis labels ('Months' and 'Values') frame interpretation, highlights April as the peak and January as the trough, and points out how MarkdownDataTable and explicit axis titles make chart data accessible and extractable. That example is representative of the book’s pattern: real examples, explicit metadata schemas, and attention to both human and machine consumers.\n\nThe latter sections focus on implementation and operational concerns: metadata consistency across documents, accessibility (clear captions and axis labels, machine‑readable descriptions), and practical techniques for extracting structured data from mixed content. The book closes with guidance for applying these ideas in real systems—indexing, search, analytics, accessibility tooling, and downstream ML—illustrating how a systematic page object approach improves reliability, discoverability, and interoperability across document workflows.\n\nTaken together, the book presents a pragmatic, example‑rich roadmap for designers and engineers who need to tame complex documents. It shows not only what to capture for each page object, but why those captures matter and how they chain together to make documents more useful to people and systems alike.",

Where previous chapters established how pages are decomposed into objects (headers, paragraphs, tables, figures) and why consistent metadata matters, this chapter drills into the figure element: its caption, embedded visual data (a bar chart), and the supplemental machine-readable metadata that describes chart type, axis titles, tabular data and footnotes. The chapter juxtaposes the human-visible figure (caption and plotted values) with the embedded descriptive attributes—Title, ChartType, TopicKeywords, DetailedDescription, MarkdownDataTable and AxisTitles—demonstrating how both forms work together to make the visual content interpretable by readers and downstream systems.\n\nThis chapter highlights practical interpretation of the figure: it enumerates monthly values from January to June (200, 300, 400, 450, 350, 250), notes April as the peak and January as the trough, and shows how the axis labels ('Months' and 'Values') frame the reader's understanding. It emphasizes key implementation concerns carried over from earlier material—consistency of metadata, accessibility (clear captions and axis labels), and extracting structured data from mixed content—so the reader sees a clear progression from defining page objects to applying those principles to a concrete visual object and its data.",
