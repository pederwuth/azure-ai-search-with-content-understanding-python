        "overall_summary": "Venture Deals is a practical, experience-driven guide to how venture capital financing actually works, written to demystify the opaque language, incentives, and documents that govern startup financings. The authors open by mapping the human ecosystem — entrepreneurs, angels, lead VCs, syndicates, lawyers, and advisors — and explain how those players’ motivations shape both the economic outcomes and control provisions in every financing. Using historical anecdotes (like the DEC/AR&D story) and clear framing, they present the term sheet as the decisive junction of economics (who gets what) and control (who makes which decisions).\n\nFrom that framing the book walks readers clause-by-clause through a modern term sheet: valuation mechanics, liquidation preferences and participation, option-pool math, anti-dilution protections, board composition, protective provisions, conversion mechanics, and the practical meaning of registration, information, and transfer rights. Interleaved with this legal and financial tour are repeated entrepreneur-focused sidebars that translate investor priorities into founder tradeoffs and negotiation tactics — what to fight for, what to accept, and how to create leverage (e.g., by creating competitive processes and choosing the right lead investor).\n\nThe authors then shift from term-sheet clauses to the concrete bookkeeping and alternate instruments that matter: a deep, worked walkthrough of capitalization tables (pre- and post-money math, option-pool effects, and rounding pitfalls) and a careful treatment of convertible debt (notes), caps, discounts, and SAFE/KISS alternatives — including the risks these instruments can create if misused. A practical legal chapter follows, highlighting recurring founder mistakes (employment terms, PIIAs/IP assignment, 83(b) elections, corporate form) and offering preventive hygiene entrepreneurs should prioritize before taking investment.\n\nFinally, the book steps back to a macro view of startup communities (the Boulder Thesis), arguing that ecosystems succeed through long-term, entrepreneur-led commitment, inclusive activity, and persistent practice. Across the book the tone remains pragmatic and tactical: it equips founders and emerging investors with the vocabulary, math, and negotiation instincts to structure deals that align incentives, preserve upside, and reduce catastrophic surprises.",

Building on the Introduction's framing of the term sheet as the artful junction of economics and control, this chapter introduces the core participants — the entrepreneur who brings the opportunity and carries most execution risk; the venture capitalist who evaluates, structures and syndicates investments; and the angel investor who often supplies early capital and mentorship. It explains financing-round nomenclature (seed, Series A, B, etc.), distinguishes types of venture firms (traditional institutional funds, micro-VCs, corporate VCs) and describes syndication dynamics: how leads set terms, how others join, and why a well-chosen lead changes negotiation leverage and term-sheet content.\n\nThe chapter also highlights the professional support ecosystem — lawyers who translate business deals into enforceable documents and mentors/advisors who add noncapital value — and points out how each player’s incentives influence eventual economic and control provisions. By clarifying roles, motivations and typical behaviors, Chapter 1 prepares the reader to understand later, more technical chapters: how investor type and syndicate structure feed directly into valuation, liquidation preferences, board composition, protective provisions and other term-sheet mechanics discussed in depth later in the book.",

            "chapter_title": "Foreword\n\nremember the first week of my career as a VC. I was 25 years\nold, it was 1986, and I had just landed a summer job in a venture\ncapital firm. I was working for three experienced venture capitalists\nin a small firm called Euclid Partners, where I ended up spending\nthe first 10 years of my VC career. One of those three partners,\nBliss McCrum, peeked his head into my office (I had an office in\nRockefeller Center at age 25) and said to me, \"Can you model out\na financing for XYZ Company at a $9 million pre-money, raising\n$3 million, with an unissued option pool of 10%?\" and then went\nback to the big office in the rear he shared with the other founding\npartner, Milton Pappas.\n\nI sat at my desk and started thinking about the request. I\nunderstood the \"raising $3 million\" bit. I thought I could figure\nout the \"unissued option pool of 10%\" bit. But what the hell was\n\"pre-money\"? I had never heard that term. This was almost a decade\nbefore Netscape and Internet search so searching online for it wasn't\nan option. After spending ten minutes getting up the courage, I\nwalked back to that big office, peeked my head in, and said to Bliss,\n\"Can you explain pre-money to me?\"\n\nThus began my 31-year education in venture capital that is still\ngoing on as I write this.\n\nThe venture capital business was a cottage industry back in 1985,\nwith club deals and a language all of its own. A cynic would say it was\ndesigned this way to be opaque to everyone other than the VCs so that\nthey would have all the leverage in negotiations with entrepreneurs.\nI don't entirely buy that narrative. I think the VC business grew up in\na few small offices in Boston, New York, and San Francisco, and the\ndozens-maybe as many as a hundred-of main participants, along\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"xiii\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"xiv Foreword\" -->\n\nwith their lawyers, came up with structures that made sense to them.\nThey then developed a shorthand so that they could communicate\namong themselves.\n\nBut whatever the origin story was, the language of venture deals\nis foreign to many and remains opaque and confusing to this day.\nThis works to the advantage of industry insiders and to the disadvan-\ntage of those who are new to startups and venture capital.\n\nIn the early 2000s, after I wound down my first venture capital\nfirm, Flatiron Partners, and before we started USV, I started blogging.\nOne of my goals with my AVC blog (at www.avc.com) was to bring\ntransparency to this opaque world that I had been inhabiting for\nalmost 20 years. I was joined in this blogging thing by Brad Feld, a\nfriend and frequent coinvestor. Club investing has not gone away\nand that's a good thing. By reading AVC and Feld Thoughts regu-\nlarly, an entrepreneur could get up to speed on startups and venture\ncapital. Brad and I received a tremendous amount of positive feed-\nback on our efforts to bring transparency to the venture capital busi-\nness so we kept doing it, and now if you search for something like\n\"participating preferred\" you will find posts written by both me and\nBrad on that first search results page.\n\nBrad and his partner Jason Mendelson (a recovering startup law-\nyer turned VC) took things a step further and wrote a book called\nVenture Deals back in 2011. It has turned into a classic and is now on\nits Third Edition. If Venture Deals had been around in 1985, I would\nnot have had to admit to Bliss that I had no idea what pre-money\nmeant.\n\nIf there is a guidebook to navigating the mysterious and confusing\nlanguage of venture capital and venture capital financing structures,\nit is Venture Deals. Anyone interested in startups, entrepreneurship,\nand angel and venture capital financings should do themselves a\nfavor and read it.\n\nFred Wilson\nUSV Partner\nJuly 2016\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->",
            "summary": "This Foreword and Preface set the stage for the rest of the book by explaining why demystifying venture capital language and term sheets matters. The Foreword (by Fred Wilson) recounts a personal anecdote about learning what \"pre-money\" meant, illustrating how opaque VC jargon can be to newcomers and why accessible explanations are valuable. The Preface then describes the authors' motivation: having distilled their experience into blog posts, they expanded that work into a comprehensive guide that balances entrepreneur and VC perspectives and adds practical context about players, processes, and negotiating term sheets.\n\nThe Preface also lays out the book's roadmap: a brief history and participant primer, practical guidance on fundraising and the VC decision process, in-depth chapters on term-sheet economics, control, and miscellaneous terms, and chapters on convertible debt, crowdfunding, VC firm economics, negotiation tactics, acquisition letters of intent, and common legal issues. It highlights new material in this edition (notably crowdfunding) and signals contributions from an entrepreneur's viewpoint (Matt Blumberg), making clear the book's practical, classroom-to-boardroom progression from mapping the players (Chapter 1) to navigating actual deal terms and dynamics.",

            "chapter_title": "Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet\n\n0\nne of the first famous venture capital investments was Digital\nEquipment Corporation (DEC). In 1957, American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation (AR&D), one of the first venture capital\nfirms, invested $70,000 in DEC. When DEC went public in 1968, this\ninvestment was worth over $355 million, or a return of over 5,000\ntimes the invested capital. AR&D's investment in DEC was one of the\noriginal venture capital home runs.\n\nIn 1957, the venture capital industry was just being created. At the\ntime, the investor community in the United States was uninterested\nin investing in computer companies, as the last wave of computer-\nrelated startups had performed poorly and even large companies\nwere having difficulty making money in the computer business. We\ncan envision the frustration of DEC's cofounders, Ken Olson and\nHarlan Anderson, as the investors they talked to rejected them\nand their fledgling idea for a business. We can also imagine their\njoy when Georges Doriot, the founder of American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation, offered to fund them. After a number\nof conversations and meetings, Doriot sent Olson and Anderson a\nletter expressing his interest in investing, along with his proposed\nterms. Today, this document is called the term sheet.\n\nNow, imagine what that term sheet looked like. There are three\ndifferent possibilities. The first is that it was a typed one-page let-\nter that said, \"We would like to invest $70,000 in your company\nand buy 78 percent of it.\" The next is that it was two pages of legal\nterms that basically said, \"We would like to invest $70,000 in your\ncompany and buy 78 percent of it.\" Or it could have been an eight-\npage typed document that had all kinds of protective provisions, vesting\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"1\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"2\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->\n\narrangements, drag-along rights, and Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission (SEC) registration rights.\n\nOur guess is that it was not the third option. Over the past 50\nyears, the art of the term sheet has evolved and expanded, reaching\nits current eight (or so) page literary masterpiece. These eight pages\ncontain a lot more than \"We'd like to invest $X in your company\nand get Y% of it,\" but, as you'll learn, there really are only two key\nthings that matter in the actual term sheet negotiation-economics\nand control.\n\nIn DEC's case, by owning 78% of the company, AR&D effec-\ntively had control of the company. And the price was clearly\ndefined-$70,000 bought 78% of the company, resulting in a $90,000\npost-money valuation.\n\nToday's venture capital investments have many more nuances.\nIndividual venture capitalists (VCs) usually end up owning less than\n50 percent of the company, so they don't have effective voting con-\ntrol but often negotiate provisions that give them control over major\ndecisions by the company. Many companies end up with multiple\nventure capitalists who invest in the company at different points in\ntime, resulting in different ownership percentages, varying rights,\nand diverging motivations. Founders don't always stay with the com-\npany through the exit and, in some cases, they end up leaving rela-\ntively early in the life of a company for a variety of reasons. Compa-\nnies fail, so venture capitalists have gotten much more focused on\nprotecting themselves for the downside as well as participating in the\nupside. Governance issues are always complex, especially when you\nhave a lot of people sitting around the negotiating table.\n\nWhile it would be desirable to do venture capital deals with a\nsimple agreement on price, a handshake, and a short legal agree-\nment, this rarely happens. And while there have been plenty of\nattempts to standardize the term sheet over the years, the prolifera-\ntion of lawyers, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs, along with a\nsteadily increasing number of investments, has prevented this from\nhappening. Ironically, the actual definitive documents have become\nmore standard over time.

            "summary": "Chapter 4, \"Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet,\" sets the stage for the practical core of the book by explaining why the term sheet matters and by situating it historically (the DEC/AR&D anecdote) and conceptually. The authors argue that although modern term sheets have grown into multi-page legal documents, the real negotiation always comes down to two axes: economics (who owns what) and control (who makes the big decisions). The chapter also introduces and clarifies the human and institutional cast involved in financings — from the different roles inside a VC firm to angels, syndicates, and lawyers — and outlines the fundraising process entrepreneurs should expect (materials, demos, due diligence, timing, and creating competitive processes).",

All of the participants were to\nblame, and ignorance of what really mattered in the negotiation\nkept things going much longer than was necessary. We talked about\nwhat to do and, at the risk of giving away super-top-secret venture\ncapital magic tricks, decided to write a blog series on Brad's blog\n(Feld Thoughts-www.feld.com) that deconstructed a venture capital\nterm sheet and explained each section.\n\nThat blog series was the inspiration for this book. The next few\nchapters cover the most frequently discussed terms in a venture capi-\ntal term sheet. Many venture capitalists (VCs) love to negotiate hard\non every term as though the health of their children depended on\nthem getting the terms just right. Sometimes this is inexperience on\nthe part of the VC; often, it's just a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe specific language that we refer to is from actual term sheets.\nIn addition to describing and explaining the specific terms, we give\nyou examples of what to focus on and implications from the perspec-\ntives of the company, VCs, and entrepreneurs.",

The authors distill VC concerns into two overarching priorities—economics and control—and then walk through the common economic and governance provisions that implement those priorities. The chapter stresses that valuation is only one piece of the economics puzzle and that other clauses (liquidation preference, pay-to-play, option pool sizing, warrants, vesting, antidilution, etc.) materially affect founder and investor outcomes. It also provides entrepreneur-centric negotiation advice (e.g., come armed with an option budget, prefer fewer warrants, and cultivate multiple investor interest to drive price).",

Because a no‑shop restricts your ability to solicit other offers, signing it without clarity can leave you effectively locked into negotiations while important items remain vague.

Practical guidance includes focusing energy on liquidation preferences, participation/convertible terms, anti‑dilution protections, option pool sizing, and control provisions that can materially dilute or cap founder returns — and being willing to de‑emphasize or trade away registration rights if doing so improves economic or governance outcomes.\n\nThe chapter also connects to earlier tactical advice: it complements Chapter 6’s admonition to insist on spelling out material employment terms before conceding exclusivity and Chapter 7’s argument for transparent information flows. Entrepreneurs are urged to embrace transparency and cooperative investor relationships to smooth the path to an IPO — because if an IPO is likely, registration rights become less central and the world is good. The takeaway is a practical prioritization: secure upside and exit‑enabling terms first, view registration rights as negotiable secondary protections, and structure the term sheet to align investor incentives with the company’s path to a public offering.",

Rather than viewing ROFR as an onerous investor grab, the chapter argues it’s useful for controlling the shareholder base, helping the company and existing shareholders by vetting transfers and giving the company notice and options when insiders seek to sell.\n\nThe chapter also offers practical guidance consistent with earlier negotiation advice: entrepreneurs should support ROFRs but be precise about their scope. Limit ROFR benefits to defined “major investors” (and be explicit about who qualifies), or condition transferee ROFRs on continued participation in future financing rounds.

It reiterates the acceptability of a ROFR that permits purchase at the valuation in a bona fide outside offer while warning against broad “effective exclusions” that swallow founder flexibility.

The bulk of the chapter then treats three boilerplate provisions—no-shop agreements, indemnification, and assignment—explaining their purpose, typical language, and pragmatic ways founders should approach them.\n\nThe treatment of no-shop provisions emphasizes process and relationships over pure legal bargaining: use a reasonably short timebound (30–60 days), require reciprocity in the VC’s commitment to close, and test the lead's seriousness before locking yourself in. Indemnification is presented as essentially unavoidable today; founders should expect to indemnify directors and investors to the fullest extent permitted by law and plan to secure D&O insurance (more common after Series A). The assignment clause simply preserves a VC firm’s internal flexibility to move positions among affiliated funds, but entrepreneurs should insist that any transferee agree in writing to be bound by the same financing agreements and avoid loopholes that transfer rights without corresponding obligations.",

            "chapter_title": "The Capitalization Table\n\nN.\now that we've worked through all of the specific clauses in the\nterm sheet, let's go through how a typical capitalization table (cap\ntable) works. A term sheet will almost always contain a summary\ncap table, which we describe in this chapter. You, your prospective\ninvestors, or occasionally your lawyers will generate a more detailed\ncap table.\n\nThe cap table summarizes who owns what part of the company\nbefore and after the financing. This is one area that some founders,\nespecially those who have not been exposed in the past to cap table\nmath, are often uncomfortable with. It's extremely important for\nfounders to understand exactly who owns what part of a company\nand what the implications are in a potential funding round.\n\nNormally when you initially set up the company, 100% will be\nallocated to the founders and employees, with a specific number of\nshares allocated to each individual. The question \"What will I own\nif a venture capitalist invests X in my company at a Y valuation?\" is\nrarely simple. To answer it, you need to be able to generate a cap\ntable to truly analyze the deal presented by a particular term sheet.\nFollowing is a model to work from with a typical example.\n\nLet's assume the following:\n\n2 million shares held by founders before the VC invests\n$10 million pre-money valuation\n$5 million investment by the VC\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"103\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"104\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->\n\nIn this example, the post-money valuation is $15 million ($10 mil-\nlion pre-money + $5 million investment). Consequently, the VCs\nown 33.33% of the company after the financing ($5 million invest-\nment/$15 million post-money valuation). This should be pretty\nstraightforward so far.\n\nNow, assume the term sheet includes a new employee option\npool of 20% on a post-money basis. Remember that this means that\nafter the financing, there will be an unallocated option pool equal\nto 20% of the company.\n\nAlthough the post-money valuation remains the same ($15 mil-\nlion), the requirement for a 20% option pool will have a significant\nimpact on the ownership of the founders. Per the cap table, you\ncan see how we calculate the percentage ownership for each class\nof owner, along with the price per share of the preferred stock. To\nstart, we've filled in the known numbers and now have to solve for\nthe unknowns (A, B, C, D, and E).\n\nFirst, let's solve for A, the founders' ownership percentage: A =\n100% minus the VC percentage minus the employee pool percent-\nage, or 100% - 33.33% - 20% = 46.67%. Given that we know that the\n2 million founders' shares represent 46.67% of the company, we can\ndetermine that the total shares outstanding (E = 2 million/ 0.4667)\nare 4,285,408. Now, if there are 4,285,408 shares outstanding, deter-\nmining the number of shares in the employee pool becomes B = E\n*0.20 or 857,081.\n\nThe same math applies for C, the number of shares of preferred\nstock the VCs have. C = E * 0.3333 or 1,428,326.

            "summary": "After the clause-by-clause tour through a term sheet in previous chapters, Chapter 12 turns to the practical bookkeeping that ties those clauses together: the capitalization table (cap table). The cap table is the numerical map of who owns what before and after a financing and is almost always summarized in the term sheet. The chapter stresses that founders must understand cap table math because ownership percentages, dilution effects, option pools, and share pricing all flow from these calculations and directly affect the economic and control outcomes of a deal.\n\nUsing a concrete example (2,000,000 founder shares, $10M pre-money, $5M investment, and a 20% post-money option pool), the chapter walks through the steps to solve for total shares outstanding, the number of shares in the option pool, the number of preferred shares issued to the VC, and the preferred price per share. It shows how a post-money option pool requirement (20%) reduces founders from 100% to 46.67% ownership and produces a post-money cap table where the VC owns 33.33%. The chapter also warns about rounding and fractional-share issues—intermediate rounding can produce material discrepancies—so entrepreneurs should verify the math themselves rather than rely entirely on counsel. Finally, it emphasizes the practical uses of the cap table: analyzing term sheets, explaining dilution to the board, and negotiating adjustments like option-pool size.",

However, there is one\nother type of financing, often used at the seed stage, called a con-\nvertible debt financing. In fact, many angel investors will invest only\nwith this structure.\n\nConvertible debt is just that: debt. It's a loan. The loan will con-\nvert to equity (preferred stock, usually) at such time as another\nround is raised. The conversion usually includes some sort of dis-\ncount on the price to the future round.\n\nFor example, assume you raise $500,000 in convertible debt\nfrom angels with a 20% discount to the next round, and six months\nlater a venture capitalist (VC) offers to lead a Series A round of a\n$1 million investment at $1 a share. Your financing will actually be\nfor $1.5 million total, although the VCs will get 1 million Series A\nshares ($1 million at $1 per share) and the angels will get 625,000\nSeries A shares ($500,000 at $0.80 per share). The discount is appro-\npriate, as your early investors want some reward for investing before\nthe full Series A financing round comes together.\n\nIn this chapter, we cover the arguments for and against using\nconvertible debt. We then go through the terms in a convertible\ndebt deal, including the discount, valuation caps, interest rate, con-\nversion mechanics, conversion in a sale of the company, warrants,\nand other terms. We briefly cover the differences between early-stage\nand late-stage dynamics and finish up with an example of when con-\nvertible debt could be dangerous to use.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"107\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"108\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->",

It explains that convertible debt is structurally a loan that typically converts into the next equity round at a discounted price (rewarding early risk). The chapter walks through the mechanics entrepreneurs should insist on (reasonable time horizon to a financing, forced conversion if the horizon passes, and floors on conversion valuation) and warns that leaving debt outstanding can give noteholders disproportionate leverage over a struggling company.\n\nThe authors unpack key economic and legal features: discounts, valuation caps (which cap the conversion price and protect early investors when the next round prices very high), conversion mechanics (qualified financing thresholds, maturity periods, automatic conversion language, and amendment/majority-consent traps), and warrants (how warrant coverage is calculated, exercise terms, merger treatment, and original-issue-discount accounting issues). They contrast early-stage (seed/bridge) use of notes with later-stage bridge financings, and present SAFEs/KISSes as non-debt alternatives—simpler in some ways but with trade-offs (no maturity, weaker investor leverage, and missing default pro-rata rights). The chapter emphasizes how these choices affect future negotiations, cap tables (Chapter 12), and investor relations (Chapter 11), and urges entrepreneurs to negotiate caps/terms thoughtfully and to be careful about disclosing seed note terms to prospective VCs.",

Leaders must commit for the long haul (the author suggests a mental horizon of ~20 years) because startup ecosystems go through recurring economic cycles and only long-term, persistent effort yields durable clusters. A vibrant community emphasizes inclusive, activity-based engagement—hackathons, meetups, accelerators, and startup weekends—that create repeated, tangible interactions across first-time founders, experienced entrepreneurs, investors, mentors, employees, and service providers.

      "overall_summary": "Venture Deals is a practical, experience-driven guide to how venture capital financing actually works, written to demystify the opaque language, incentives, and documents that govern startup financings. The authors open by mapping the human ecosystem — entrepreneurs, angels, lead VCs, syndicates, lawyers, and advisors — and explain how those players’ motivations shape both the economic outcomes and control provisions in every financing. Using historical anecdotes (like the DEC/AR&D story) and clear framing, they present the term sheet as the decisive junction of economics (who gets what) and control (who makes which decisions).\n\nFrom that framing the book walks readers clause-by-clause through a modern term sheet: valuation mechanics, liquidation preferences and participation, option-pool math, anti-dilution protections, board composition, protective provisions, conversion mechanics, and the practical meaning of registration, information, and transfer rights. Interleaved with this legal and financial tour are repeated entrepreneur-focused sidebars that translate investor priorities into founder tradeoffs and negotiation tactics — what to fight for, what to accept, and how to create leverage (e.g., by creating competitive processes and choosing the right lead investor).\n\nThe authors then shift from term-sheet clauses to the concrete bookkeeping and alternate instruments that matter: a deep, worked walkthrough of capitalization tables (pre- and post-money math, option-pool effects, and rounding pitfalls) and a careful treatment of convertible debt (notes), caps, discounts, and SAFE/KISS alternatives — including the risks these instruments can create if misused. A practical legal chapter follows, highlighting recurring founder mistakes (employment terms, PIIAs/IP assignment, 83(b) elections, corporate form) and offering preventive hygiene entrepreneurs should prioritize before taking investment.\n\nFinally, the book steps back to a macro view of startup communities (the Boulder Thesis), arguing that ecosystems succeed through long-term, entrepreneur-led commitment, inclusive activity, and persistent practice. Across the book the tone remains pragmatic and tactical: it equips founders and emerging investors with the vocabulary, math, and negotiation instincts to structure deals that align incentives, preserve upside, and reduce catastrophic surprises.",

I was working for three experienced venture capitalists\nin a small firm called Euclid Partners, where I ended up spending\nthe first 10 years of my VC career. One of those three partners,\nBliss McCrum, peeked his head into my office (I had an office in\nRockefeller Center at age 25) and said to me, \"Can you model out\na financing for XYZ Company at a $9 million pre-money, raising\n$3 million, with an unissued option pool of 10%?\" and then went\nback to the big office in the rear he shared with the other founding\npartner, Milton Pappas.\n\nI sat at my desk and started thinking about the request. I\nunderstood the \"raising $3 million\" bit. I thought I could figure\nout the \"unissued option pool of 10%\" bit. But what the hell was\n\"pre-money\"? I had never heard that term. This was almost a decade\nbefore Netscape and Internet search so searching online for it wasn't\nan option. After spending ten minutes getting up the courage, I\nwalked back to that big office, peeked my head in, and said to Bliss,\n\"Can you explain pre-money to me?\"\n\nThus began my 31-year education in venture capital that is still\ngoing on as I write this.\n\nThe venture capital business was a cottage industry back in 1985,\nwith club deals and a language all of its own. A cynic would say it was\ndesigned this way to be opaque to everyone other than the VCs so that\nthey would have all the leverage in negotiations with entrepreneurs.\nI don't entirely buy that narrative. I think the VC business grew up in\na few small offices in Boston, New York, and San Francisco, and the\ndozens-maybe as many as a hundred-of main participants, along\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"xiii\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"xiv Foreword\" -->\n\nwith their lawyers, came up with structures that made sense to them.\nThey then developed a shorthand so that they could communicate\namong themselves.\n\nBut whatever the origin story was, the language of venture deals\nis foreign to many and remains opaque and confusing to this day.\nThis works to the advantage of industry insiders and to the disadvan-\ntage of those who are new to startups and venture capital.\n\nIn the early 2000s, after I wound down my first venture capital\nfirm, Flatiron Partners, and before we started USV, I started blogging.\nOne of my goals with my AVC blog (at www.avc.com) was to bring\ntransparency to this opaque world that I had been inhabiting for\nalmost 20 years. I was joined in this blogging thing by Brad Feld, a\nfriend and frequent coinvestor. Club investing has not gone away\nand that's a good thing. By reading AVC and Feld Thoughts regu-\nlarly, an entrepreneur could get up to speed on startups and venture\ncapital. Brad and I received a tremendous amount of positive feed-\nback on our efforts to bring transparency to the venture capital busi-\nness so we kept doing it, and now if you search for something like\n\"participating preferred\" you will find posts written by both me and\nBrad on that first search results page.\n\nBrad and his partner Jason Mendelson (a recovering startup law-\nyer turned VC) took things a step further and wrote a book called\nVenture Deals back in 2011. It has turned into a classic and is now on\nits Third Edition. If Venture Deals had been around in 1985, I would\nnot have had to admit to Bliss that I had no idea what pre-money\nmeant.\n\nIf there is a guidebook to navigating the mysterious and confusing\nlanguage of venture capital and venture capital financing structures,\nit is Venture Deals. Anyone interested in startups, entrepreneurship,\nand angel and venture capital financings should do themselves a\nfavor and read it.\n\nFred Wilson\nUSV Partner\nJuly 2016\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->",

The Foreword (by Fred Wilson) recounts a personal anecdote about learning what \"pre-money\" meant, illustrating how opaque VC jargon can be to newcomers and why accessible explanations are valuable. The Preface then describes the authors' motivation: having distilled their experience into blog posts, they expanded that work into a comprehensive guide that balances entrepreneur and VC perspectives and adds practical context about players, processes, and negotiating term sheets.\n\nThe Preface also lays out the book's roadmap: a brief history and participant primer, practical guidance on fundraising and the VC decision process, in-depth chapters on term-sheet economics, control, and miscellaneous terms, and chapters on convertible debt, crowdfunding, VC firm economics, negotiation tactics, acquisition letters of intent, and common legal issues. It highlights new material in this edition (notably crowdfunding) and signals contributions from an entrepreneur's viewpoint (Matt Blumberg), making clear the book's practical, classroom-to-boardroom progression from mapping the players (Chapter 1) to navigating actual deal terms and dynamics.",

          "chapter_title": "Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet\n\n0\nne of the first famous venture capital investments was Digital\nEquipment Corporation (DEC). In 1957, American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation (AR&D), one of the first venture capital\nfirms, invested $70,000 in DEC. When DEC went public in 1968, this\ninvestment was worth over $355 million, or a return of over 5,000\ntimes the invested capital. AR&D's investment in DEC was one of the\noriginal venture capital home runs.\n\nIn 1957, the venture capital industry was just being created. At the\ntime, the investor community in the United States was uninterested\nin investing in computer companies, as the last wave of computer-\nrelated startups had performed poorly and even large companies\nwere having difficulty making money in the computer business. We\ncan envision the frustration of DEC's cofounders, Ken Olson and\nHarlan Anderson, as the investors they talked to rejected them\nand their fledgling idea for a business. We can also imagine their\njoy when Georges Doriot, the founder of American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation, offered to fund them. After a number\nof conversations and meetings, Doriot sent Olson and Anderson a\nletter expressing his interest in investing, along with his proposed\nterms. Today, this document is called the term sheet.\n\nNow, imagine what that term sheet looked like. There are three\ndifferent possibilities. The first is that it was a typed one-page let-\nter that said, \"We would like to invest $70,000 in your company\nand buy 78 percent of it.\" The next is that it was two pages of legal\nterms that basically said, \"We would like to invest $70,000 in your\ncompany and buy 78 percent of it.\" Or it could have been an eight-\npage typed document that had all kinds of protective provisions, vesting\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"1\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"2\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->\n\narrangements, drag-along rights, and Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission (SEC) registration rights.\n\nOur guess is that it was not the third option. Over the past 50\nyears, the art of the term sheet has evolved and expanded, reaching\nits current eight (or so) page literary masterpiece. These eight pages\ncontain a lot more than \"We'd like to invest $X in your company\nand get Y% of it,\" but, as you'll learn, there really are only two key\nthings that matter in the actual term sheet negotiation-economics\nand control.\n\nIn DEC's case, by owning 78% of the company, AR&D effec-\ntively had control of the company. And the price was clearly\ndefined-$70,000 bought 78% of the company, resulting in a $90,000\npost-money valuation.\n\nToday's venture capital investments have many more nuances.\nIndividual venture capitalists (VCs) usually end up owning less than\n50 percent of the company, so they don't have effective voting con-\ntrol but often negotiate provisions that give them control over major\ndecisions by the company. Many companies end up with multiple\nventure capitalists who invest in the company at different points in\ntime, resulting in different ownership percentages, varying rights,\nand diverging motivations. Founders don't always stay with the com-\npany through the exit and, in some cases, they end up leaving rela-\ntively early in the life of a company for a variety of reasons. Compa-\nnies fail, so venture capitalists have gotten much more focused on\nprotecting themselves for the downside as well as participating in the\nupside. Governance issues are always complex, especially when you\nhave a lot of people sitting around the negotiating table.\n\nWhile it would be desirable to do venture capital deals with a\nsimple agreement on price, a handshake, and a short legal agree-\nment, this rarely happens. And while there have been plenty of\nattempts to standardize the term sheet over the years, the prolifera-\ntion of lawyers, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs, along with a\nsteadily increasing number of investments, has prevented this from\nhappening. Ironically, the actual definitive documents have become\nmore standard over time. Whether it is the Internet age that has\nspread information across the ecosystem or clients growing tired of\npaying legal bills, there are more similarities in the documents today\nthan ever before. As a result, we can lend you our experience in how\nventure financings are usually done. The good news is once you've\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"3\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet\" -->\n\nnegotiated the term sheet, you are done with the hard part. As a\nresult, that's where we are going to focus our energy in this book.\n\nThroughout this book we will cover not only the what and the\nhow, but also the why things work as they do. Let's begin our explora-\ntion of venture capital financings by discussing the various players\ninvolved.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer and Venture Capitalist, Third Edition By Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson Copyright @ 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\" -->",
          "summary": "Chapter 4, \"Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet,\" sets the stage for the practical core of the book by explaining why the term sheet matters and by situating it historically (the DEC/AR&D anecdote) and conceptually. The authors argue that although modern term sheets have grown into multi-page legal documents, the real negotiation always comes down to two axes: economics (who owns what) and control (who makes the big decisions). The chapter also introduces and clarifies the human and institutional cast involved in financings — from the different roles inside a VC firm to angels, syndicates, and lawyers — and outlines the fundraising process entrepreneurs should expect (materials, demos, due diligence, timing, and creating competitive processes).",

          "chapter_title": "Overview of the Term Sheet\n\nA\nt the end of 2005, during the dark ages when venture capital was\nvery much out of favor, we participated in a financing that was much\nmore difficult than it needed to be. All of the participants were to\nblame, and ignorance of what really mattered in the negotiation\nkept things going much longer than was necessary. We talked about\nwhat to do and, at the risk of giving away super-top-secret venture\ncapital magic tricks, decided to write a blog series on Brad's blog\n(Feld Thoughts-www.feld.com) that deconstructed a venture capital\nterm sheet and explained each section.\n\nThat blog series was the inspiration for this book. The next few\nchapters cover the most frequently discussed terms in a venture capi-\ntal term sheet. Many venture capitalists (VCs) love to negotiate hard\non every term as though the health of their children depended on\nthem getting the terms just right. Sometimes this is inexperience on\nthe part of the VC; often, it's just a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe specific language that we refer to is from actual term sheets.\nIn addition to describing and explaining the specific terms, we give\nyou examples of what to focus on and implications from the perspec-\ntives of the company, VCs, and entrepreneurs.",
          "summary": "Building on the book's mission (introduced in the Foreword and Preface) to demystify VC jargon and on the Introduction’s framing of the term sheet as the decisive document of a financing, Chapter 5 offers a systematic overview of a term sheet by identifying what really matters in negotiations and why. The authors distill VC concerns into two overarching priorities—economics and control—and then walk through the common economic and governance provisions that implement those priorities. The chapter stresses that valuation is only one piece of the economics puzzle and that other clauses (liquidation preference, pay-to-play, option pool sizing, warrants, vesting, antidilution, etc.) materially affect founder and investor outcomes. It also provides entrepreneur-centric negotiation advice (e.g., come armed with an option budget, prefer fewer warrants, and cultivate multiple investor interest to drive price).",

Because a no‑shop restricts your ability to solicit other offers, signing it without clarity can leave you effectively locked into negotiations while important items remain vague.

It positions routine reporting as part of running a modern, well-managed company and as a prerequisite for outside investment, while advising founders to pair disclosure obligations with confidentiality clauses and clear limits to avoid unnecessary administrative burden or competitive harm.

Building on the book’s earlier framing of the term sheet as the decisive document, the chapter advises founders to think forward to exit scenarios (especially an IPO) and to structure deals so that founder economics and upside participation are protected. Practical guidance includes focusing energy on liquidation preferences, participation/convertible terms, anti‑dilution protections, option pool sizing, and control provisions that can materially dilute or cap founder returns — and being willing to de‑emphasize or trade away registration rights if doing so improves economic or governance outcomes.\n\nThe chapter also connects to earlier tactical advice: it complements Chapter 6’s admonition to insist on spelling out material employment terms before conceding exclusivity and Chapter 7’s argument for transparent information flows. Entrepreneurs are urged to embrace transparency and cooperative investor relationships to smooth the path to an IPO — because if an IPO is likely, registration rights become less central and the world is good.

The chapter defines typical ROFR language, explains that the clause is easier to manage if placed in the company bylaws (so it’s centralized and hard to miss), and traces how historical attitudes shifted: early VC orthodoxy often blocked founder sales until investor liquidity, but the rise of secondary markets and longer liquidity horizons changed practice. Rather than viewing ROFR as an onerous investor grab, the chapter argues it’s useful for controlling the shareholder base, helping the company and existing shareholders by vetting transfers and giving the company notice and options when insiders seek to sell.\n\nThe chapter also offers practical guidance consistent with earlier negotiation advice: entrepreneurs should support ROFRs but be precise about their scope. Limit ROFR benefits to defined “major investors” (and be explicit about who qualifies), or condition transferee ROFRs on continued participation in future financing rounds. The authors recommend putting the restriction in the bylaws to avoid fragmentation across many documents, and note the broader regulatory context—the SEC’s increased scrutiny—making control and transparency around transfers even more important.",

It frames these agreements as standard, company-protecting documents that prevent later ownership and confidentiality disputes, and recommends resolving any legitimate pre-existing work-in-progress exceptions up front with investors.\n\nBuilding on the book’s earlier negotiation framing, the chapter then addresses the co‑sale/right‑of‑first‑refusal regime from a pragmatic angle: you probably won’t eliminate co‑sale rights entirely, but you should ask for reasonable floors and exclusions so small, bona fide founder liquidity events (for example, selling a bit of stock to buy a house) aren’t blocked. It reiterates the acceptability of a ROFR that permits purchase at the valuation in a bona fide outside offer while warning against broad “effective exclusions” that swallow founder flexibility. The thrust is balance: protect IP and company value while negotiating sensible limitations on investor transfer controls to preserve founder practicality and morale.",

          "summary": "Chapter 11 continues the entrepreneur-focused thread from earlier chapters by walking through several standard but often glossed clauses in a venture term sheet and explaining why, in most cases, founders should accept them rather than fight. The chapter opens with a blunt practical warning about founders' activities clauses: if you cannot agree to such restrictions, traditional VC financing is unlikely to be successful unless you negotiate narrow carve-outs and accept likely tradeoffs (for example, changes to vesting or IP ownership). The bulk of the chapter then treats three boilerplate provisions—no-shop agreements, indemnification, and assignment—explaining their purpose, typical language, and pragmatic ways founders should approach them.\n\nThe treatment of no-shop provisions emphasizes process and relationships over pure legal bargaining: use a reasonably short timebound (30–60 days), require reciprocity in the VC’s commitment to close, and test the lead's seriousness before locking yourself in. Indemnification is presented as essentially unavoidable today; founders should expect to indemnify directors and investors to the fullest extent permitted by law and plan to secure D&O insurance (more common after Series A). The assignment clause simply preserves a VC firm’s internal flexibility to move positions among affiliated funds, but entrepreneurs should insist that any transferee agree in writing to be bound by the same financing agreements and avoid loopholes that transfer rights without corresponding obligations.",

          "chapter_title": "The Capitalization Table\n\nN.\now that we've worked through all of the specific clauses in the\nterm sheet, let's go through how a typical capitalization table (cap\ntable) works. A term sheet will almost always contain a summary\ncap table, which we describe in this chapter. You, your prospective\ninvestors, or occasionally your lawyers will generate a more detailed\ncap table.\n\nThe cap table summarizes who owns what part of the company\nbefore and after the financing. This is one area that some founders,\nespecially those who have not been exposed in the past to cap table\nmath, are often uncomfortable with. It's extremely important for\nfounders to understand exactly who owns what part of a company\nand what the implications are in a potential funding round.\n\nNormally when you initially set up the company, 100% will be\nallocated to the founders and employees, with a specific number of\nshares allocated to each individual. The question \"What will I own\nif a venture capitalist invests X in my company at a Y valuation?\" is\nrarely simple. To answer it, you need to be able to generate a cap\ntable to truly analyze the deal presented by a particular term sheet.\nFollowing is a model to work from with a typical example.\n\nLet's assume the following:\n\n2 million shares held by founders before the VC invests\n$10 million pre-money valuation\n$5 million investment by the VC\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"103\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"104\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->\n\nIn this example, the post-money valuation is $15 million ($10 mil-\nlion pre-money + $5 million investment). Consequently, the VCs\nown 33.33% of the company after the financing ($5 million invest-\nment/$15 million post-money valuation). This should be pretty\nstraightforward so far.\n\nNow, assume the term sheet includes a new employee option\npool of 20% on a post-money basis. Remember that this means that\nafter the financing, there will be an unallocated option pool equal\nto 20% of the company.\n\nAlthough the post-money valuation remains the same ($15 mil-\nlion), the requirement for a 20% option pool will have a significant\nimpact on the ownership of the founders. Per the cap table, you\ncan see how we calculate the percentage ownership for each class\nof owner, along with the price per share of the preferred stock. To\nstart, we've filled in the known numbers and now have to solve for\nthe unknowns (A, B, C, D, and E).\n\nFirst, let's solve for A, the founders' ownership percentage: A =\n100% minus the VC percentage minus the employee pool percent-\nage, or 100% - 33.33% - 20% = 46.67%. Given that we know that the\n2 million founders' shares represent 46.67% of the company, we can\ndetermine that the total shares outstanding (E = 2 million/ 0.4667)\nare 4,285,408. Now, if there are 4,285,408 shares outstanding, deter-\nmining the number of shares in the employee pool becomes B = E\n*0.20 or 857,081.\n\nThe same math applies for C, the number of shares of preferred\nstock the VCs have. C = E * 0.3333 or 1,428,326. Since $5 million\nbought 1,428,326 shares of preferred stock, then the price per share\nof preferred stock (D = $5 million/1,428,326) is $3.50 per share.\n\nFinally, always check your calculation. Since we know we have a\n$10 million pre-money valuation, then the shares prior to the financ-\ning (2 million founders' shares plus the 20% option pool) times the\nprice per share should equal $10 million. If you do this math, you'll\n\n\n<table>\n<caption>Example Capitalization Table</caption>\n<tr>\n<th>Class</th>\n<th>Shares</th>\n<th>Preferred Price</th>\n<th>Valuation</th>\n<th>Percentage</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Founders</td>\n<td>2,000,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Employee pool</td>\n<td>B</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Venture investors</td>\n<td>C</td>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>$5,000,000</td>\n<td>33.33%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>E</td>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>$15,000,000</td>\n<td>100%</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"105\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"The Capitalization Table\" -->\n\nsee that (2 million + 857,081) * $3.50 = $9,999,783.50. Oops, we are\noff by $216.50, which represents 62 shares (well, 61.857 shares).\n\nWhile this is close enough for an example, it's not close enough\nfor most VCs, or for most lawyers for that matter. And it shouldn't\nbe close enough for you. That's why most cap tables have two addi-\ntional significant digits (or fractional shares)-the rounding to the\nnearest share doesn't happen during intermediate steps but only at\nthe very end.\n\nAs the entrepreneur, you shouldn't blindly rely on legal counsel\nto generate these documents. There are a lot of good lawyers out\nthere with poor math skills, and the cap table can get messed up\nwhen left in the hands of the lawyers. Although some get it right, it's\nyour responsibility as the entrepreneur to make sure you understand\nyour cap table. This will be especially helpful at times when you want\nto expand the employee option pool and you are eloquent in front\nof your board of directors explaining the ramifications.",
          "summary": "After the clause-by-clause tour through a term sheet in previous chapters, Chapter 12 turns to the practical bookkeeping that ties those clauses together: the capitalization table (cap table). The cap table is the numerical map of who owns what before and after a financing and is almost always summarized in the term sheet. The chapter stresses that founders must understand cap table math because ownership percentages, dilution effects, option pools, and share pricing all flow from these calculations and directly affect the economic and control outcomes of a deal.\n\nUsing a concrete example (2,000,000 founder shares, $10M pre-money, $5M investment, and a 20% post-money option pool), the chapter walks through the steps to solve for total shares outstanding, the number of shares in the option pool, the number of preferred shares issued to the VC, and the preferred price per share. It shows how a post-money option pool requirement (20%) reduces founders from 100% to 46.67% ownership and produces a post-money cap table where the VC owns 33.33%. The chapter also warns about rounding and fractional-share issues—intermediate rounding can produce material discrepancies—so entrepreneurs should verify the math themselves rather than rely entirely on counsel. Finally, it emphasizes the practical uses of the cap table: analyzing term sheets, explaining dilution to the board, and negotiating adjustments like option-pool size.",

          "chapter_title": "Convertible Debt\n\nI,\nn the past few chapters we've gone through, in detail, the terms\nin a typical venture capital equity financing. However, there is one\nother type of financing, often used at the seed stage, called a con-\nvertible debt financing. In fact, many angel investors will invest only\nwith this structure.\n\nConvertible debt is just that: debt. It's a loan. The loan will con-\nvert to equity (preferred stock, usually) at such time as another\nround is raised. The conversion usually includes some sort of dis-\ncount on the price to the future round.\n\nFor example, assume you raise $500,000 in convertible debt\nfrom angels with a 20% discount to the next round, and six months\nlater a venture capitalist (VC) offers to lead a Series A round of a\n$1 million investment at $1 a share. Your financing will actually be\nfor $1.5 million total, although the VCs will get 1 million Series A\nshares ($1 million at $1 per share) and the angels will get 625,000\nSeries A shares ($500,000 at $0.80 per share). The discount is appro-\npriate, as your early investors want some reward for investing before\nthe full Series A financing round comes together.\n\nIn this chapter, we cover the arguments for and against using\nconvertible debt. We then go through the terms in a convertible\ndebt deal, including the discount, valuation caps, interest rate, con-\nversion mechanics, conversion in a sale of the company, warrants,\nand other terms. We briefly cover the differences between early-stage\nand late-stage dynamics and finish up with an example of when con-\nvertible debt could be dangerous to use.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"107\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"108\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->",

It explains that convertible debt is structurally a loan that typically converts into the next equity round at a discounted price (rewarding early risk). The chapter walks through the mechanics entrepreneurs should insist on (reasonable time horizon to a financing, forced conversion if the horizon passes, and floors on conversion valuation) and warns that leaving debt outstanding can give noteholders disproportionate leverage over a struggling company.\n\nThe authors unpack key economic and legal features: discounts, valuation caps (which cap the conversion price and protect early investors when the next round prices very high), conversion mechanics (qualified financing thresholds, maturity periods, automatic conversion language, and amendment/majority-consent traps), and warrants (how warrant coverage is calculated, exercise terms, merger treatment, and original-issue-discount accounting issues). They contrast early-stage (seed/bridge) use of notes with later-stage bridge financings, and present SAFEs/KISSes as non-debt alternatives—simpler in some ways but with trade-offs (no maturity, weaker investor leverage, and missing default pro-rata rights). The chapter emphasizes how these choices affect future negotiations, cap tables (Chapter 12), and investor relations (Chapter 11), and urges entrepreneurs to negotiate caps/terms thoughtfully and to be careful about disclosing seed note terms to prospective VCs.",

Leaders must commit for the long haul (the author suggests a mental horizon of ~20 years) because startup ecosystems go through recurring economic cycles and only long-term, persistent effort yields durable clusters. A vibrant community emphasizes inclusive, activity-based engagement—hackathons, meetups, accelerators, and startup weekends—that create repeated, tangible interactions across first-time founders, experienced entrepreneurs, investors, mentors, employees, and service providers.
