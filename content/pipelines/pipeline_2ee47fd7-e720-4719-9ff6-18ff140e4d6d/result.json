It begins by introducing the page-object approach and the core ideas of page structure, metadata, and component encapsulation. From these foundations the text immediately moves to a concrete example — a single figure implemented as a page object — to make abstract principles tangible. That example, a bar chart of monthly values with explicit axis labels, a Markdown data table, color-encoded categories, annotations and a caption, illustrates how visual content and descriptive metadata work together to create communicative, testable artifacts.\n\nAfter grounding readers with the example, the book expands outward to show how the same approach scales and generalizes: different chart types, composition of multiple figures into pages or reports, linking data tables to plots, and encoding semantic structure such as axis titles, categories, and annotations. Along the way it emphasizes the role of metadata and machine-readable descriptions (captions, footnotes, data provenance) in making visualizations reproducible, interpretable, and interoperable with downstream tooling.\n\nThe narrative then turns to practicalities: implementation patterns, serialization and interchange formats (for example Markdown tables and structured metadata), testing and validation of page objects, and accessibility considerations that ensure figures are useful to broad audiences. The book shows how to build libraries and pipelines that produce consistent, high-quality figures for reports, papers, dashboards, and automated workflows.\n\nFinally, the book synthesizes these strands into guidance for production use: conventions for naming and organizing page objects, best practices for color encoding and annotation, strategies for documenting and publishing figures, and recipes for integrating page-object visualizations into reproducible research and deployment pipelines. Readers finish with a clear toolkit for designing, producing, and maintaining figures that are both visually effective and semantically robust.",
