        "overall_summary": "Venture Deals is a practical, inside‑out guide to how venture capital financings actually work, aimed at entrepreneurs, their lawyers, and new entrants to the startup finance ecosystem. The book opens by mapping the players — founders, angels, VCs, syndicates, lawyers and mentors — and explains their differing motivations and incentives. Using the historical AR&D/DEC example and decades of deal experience, the authors show how simple investment letters evolved into today’s multi‑page term sheets and argue that every negotiation reduces to two core levers: economics (who gets what) and control (who makes or blocks decisions).\n\nFrom that framing the text walks readers through the anatomy of term sheets: valuation and price mechanics, liquidation preferences and participation, option pool sizing, vesting, dilution protections (antidilution), board composition and protective provisions. Interleaved throughout are entrepreneur‑focused sidebars and tactical advice: when to insist on written employment terms, how to handle no‑shop clauses, the practical meaning of information and registration rights, and sensible approaches to co‑sale and ROFR provisions. The authors emphasize that a signed term sheet starts the binding negotiation path rather than completes it and caution founders to watch for provisions that are accidentally made binding.\n\nThe book also covers the tools founders most need: how to build and validate a capitalization table, how convertible debt (notes and SAFEs) works and where it can create pitfalls, and the essential legal hygiene every founder must understand (employment arrangements, 83(b) elections, corporate form selection, indemnification and D&O insurance). Practical numeric examples and cap‑table algebra demystify dilution math and show how post‑money option pools dilute founders, not incoming investors.\n\nFinally, Venture Deals steps back to place startups in context with a short manifesto on ecosystem building (the Boulder Thesis): entrepreneurship clusters because of real, local advantages and succeed best when entrepreneur‑led, long‑term, inclusive, and activity‑driven. Overall, the book combines deal mechanics, negotiation strategy, legal reminders and community wisdom into a single handbook that helps readers negotiate smarter, avoid common traps, and align incentives for long‑term company building.",

            "summary": "Chapter 1, \"The Players,\" maps the ecosystem of people and institutions that populate the venture-capital process and explains their motivations and roles. It profiles the entrepreneur (product and company builder whose goals are growth and control), the venture capitalist (focused on portfolio returns, staged investing, and governance), angels (early, often founder-friendly capital providers), syndicates (groups of investors that share risk and carry influence), lawyers (who translate business deals into binding documents), and mentors (who provide advisory and network value). The chapter also clarifies financing-round nomenclature (seed, Series A/B/C, growth rounds) and the different types of VC firms (seed/early-stage, later-stage, corporate, micro-VC), giving entrepreneurs a practical vocabulary for understanding who they will be dealing with and why each player behaves the way they do.\n\nBuilding on the Introduction's framing of the \"art of the term sheet,\" this chapter shows that term-sheet outcomes are the product of personalities, incentives, and market roles as much as they are of technical legal clauses. It emphasizes how the choice of investor—lead versus syndicate member, angel versus institutional VC—affects negotiation leverage, governance expectations, due-diligence intensity, and the kinds of protective/control provisions investors will demand. By mapping who participates in a financing and how they interact, the chapter sets the stage for the later, more detailed discussions of economic and control terms in Chapters 3–6 and the practical fundraising steps in Chapter 2.",

            "chapter_title": "Foreword\n\nremember the first week of my career as a VC. I was 25 years\nold, it was 1986, and I had just landed a summer job in a venture\ncapital firm. I was working for three experienced venture capitalists\nin a small firm called Euclid Partners, where I ended up spending\nthe first 10 years of my VC career. One of those three partners,\nBliss McCrum, peeked his head into my office (I had an office in\nRockefeller Center at age 25) and said to me, \"Can you model out\na financing for XYZ Company at a $9 million pre-money, raising\n$3 million, with an unissued option pool of 10%?\" and then went\nback to the big office in the rear he shared with the other founding\npartner, Milton Pappas.\n\nI sat at my desk and started thinking about the request. I\nunderstood the \"raising $3 million\" bit. I thought I could figure\nout the \"unissued option pool of 10%\" bit. But what the hell was\n\"pre-money\"? I had never heard that term. This was almost a decade\nbefore Netscape and Internet search so searching online for it wasn't\nan option. After spending ten minutes getting up the courage, I\nwalked back to that big office, peeked my head in, and said to Bliss,\n\"Can you explain pre-money to me?\"\n\nThus began my 31-year education in venture capital that is still\ngoing on as I write this.\n\nThe venture capital business was a cottage industry back in 1985,\nwith club deals and a language all of its own. A cynic would say it was\ndesigned this way to be opaque to everyone other than the VCs so that\nthey would have all the leverage in negotiations with entrepreneurs.\nI don't entirely buy that narrative. I think the VC business grew up in\na few small offices in Boston, New York, and San Francisco, and the\ndozens-maybe as many as a hundred-of main participants, along\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"xiii\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"xiv Foreword\" -->\n\nwith their lawyers, came up with structures that made sense to them.\nThey then developed a shorthand so that they could communicate\namong themselves.\n\nBut whatever the origin story was, the language of venture deals\nis foreign to many and remains opaque and confusing to this day.\nThis works to the advantage of industry insiders and to the disadvan-\ntage of those who are new to startups and venture capital.\n\nIn the early 2000s, after I wound down my first venture capital\nfirm, Flatiron Partners, and before we started USV, I started blogging.\nOne of my goals with my AVC blog (at www.avc.com) was to bring\ntransparency to this opaque world that I had been inhabiting for\nalmost 20 years. I was joined in this blogging thing by Brad Feld, a\nfriend and frequent coinvestor. Club investing has not gone away\nand that's a good thing. By reading AVC and Feld Thoughts regu-\nlarly, an entrepreneur could get up to speed on startups and venture\ncapital. Brad and I received a tremendous amount of positive feed-\nback on our efforts to bring transparency to the venture capital busi-\nness so we kept doing it, and now if you search for something like\n\"participating preferred\" you will find posts written by both me and\nBrad on that first search results page.\n\nBrad and his partner Jason Mendelson (a recovering startup law-\nyer turned VC) took things a step further and wrote a book called\nVenture Deals back in 2011. It has turned into a classic and is now on\nits Third Edition. If Venture Deals had been around in 1985, I would\nnot have had to admit to Bliss that I had no idea what pre-money\nmeant.\n\nIf there is a guidebook to navigating the mysterious and confusing\nlanguage of venture capital and venture capital financing structures,\nit is Venture Deals. Anyone interested in startups, entrepreneurship,\nand angel and venture capital financings should do themselves a\nfavor and read it.\n\nFred Wilson\nUSV Partner\nJuly 2016\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->",
            "summary": "Chapter 2 (Foreword and Preface) frames the book’s mission: demystify the opaque language and mechanics of venture capital financings for entrepreneurs and new entrants. The Foreword (by Fred Wilson) begins with a personal anecdote about encountering the term “pre‑money,” highlighting how VC jargon and structures evolved among a small group of practitioners and have remained obscure to outsiders. The Preface explains the book’s origins (the Term Sheet Series blog posts) and outlines the authors’ intent to provide a practical, balanced guide that covers the players, the fundraising process, the specific terms in term sheets (economics, control, and miscellaneous), convertible debt, crowdfunding, VC firm operations, negotiation tactics, acquisition letters of intent, and common legal issues. It also notes the inclusion of an entrepreneur’s perspective (Matt Blumberg) to keep the guide grounded in real founder experience.\n\nBuilding on Chapter 1’s mapping of the VC ecosystem and its participants, this chapter explicitly positions the rest of the book as a toolkit: it will translate the roles and motivations described earlier into actionable knowledge about how deals are structured and negotiated. The Preface describes the structure of the book, signals where readers will find deep dives (e.g., term categories, negotiation, financing stages), and highlights new topics for this edition such as crowdfunding and practical firm‑level incentives. Overall, this chapter moves the reader from understanding who the players are (Chapter 1) to learning how those players interact contractually and strategically in fundraising and exits.",

            "chapter_title": "Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet\n\n0\nne of the first famous venture capital investments was Digital\nEquipment Corporation (DEC). In 1957, American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation (AR&D), one of the first venture capital\nfirms, invested $70,000 in DEC. When DEC went public in 1968, this\ninvestment was worth over $355 million, or a return of over 5,000\ntimes the invested capital. AR&D's investment in DEC was one of the\noriginal venture capital home runs.\n\nIn 1957, the venture capital industry was just being created. At the\ntime, the investor community in the United States was uninterested\nin investing in computer companies, as the last wave of computer-\nrelated startups had performed poorly and even large companies\nwere having difficulty making money in the computer business. We\ncan envision the frustration of DEC's cofounders, Ken Olson and\nHarlan Anderson, as the investors they talked to rejected them\nand their fledgling idea for a business. We can also imagine their\njoy when Georges Doriot, the founder of American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation, offered to fund them. After a number\nof conversations and meetings, Doriot sent Olson and Anderson a\nletter expressing his interest in investing, along with his proposed\nterms. Today, this document is called the term sheet.\n\nNow, imagine what that term sheet looked like. There are three\ndifferent possibilities. The first is that it was a typed one-page let-\nter that said, \"We would like to invest $70,000 in your company\nand buy 78 percent of it.\" The next is that it was two pages of legal\nterms that basically said, \"We would like to invest $70,000 in your\ncompany and buy 78 percent of it.\" Or it could have been an eight-\npage typed document that had all kinds of protective provisions, vesting\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"1\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"2\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->\n\narrangements, drag-along rights, and Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission (SEC) registration rights.\n\nOur guess is that it was not the third option. Over the past 50\nyears, the art of the term sheet has evolved and expanded, reaching\nits current eight (or so) page literary masterpiece. These eight pages\ncontain a lot more than \"We'd like to invest $X in your company\nand get Y% of it,\" but, as you'll learn, there really are only two key\nthings that matter in the actual term sheet negotiation-economics\nand control.\n\nIn DEC's case, by owning 78% of the company, AR&D effec-\ntively had control of the company. And the price was clearly\ndefined-$70,000 bought 78% of the company, resulting in a $90,000\npost-money valuation.\n\nToday's venture capital investments have many more nuances.\nIndividual venture capitalists (VCs) usually end up owning less than\n50 percent of the company, so they don't have effective voting con-\ntrol but often negotiate provisions that give them control over major\ndecisions by the company. Many companies end up with multiple\nventure capitalists who invest in the company at different points in\ntime, resulting in different ownership percentages, varying rights,\nand diverging motivations. Founders don't always stay with the com-\npany through the exit and, in some cases, they end up leaving rela-\ntively early in the life of a company for a variety of reasons. Compa-\nnies fail, so venture capitalists have gotten much more focused on\nprotecting themselves for the downside as well as participating in the\nupside. Governance issues are always complex, especially when you\nhave a lot of people sitting around the negotiating table.\n\nWhile it would be desirable to do venture capital deals with a\nsimple agreement on price, a handshake, and a short legal agree-\nment, this rarely happens. And while there have been plenty of\nattempts to standardize the term sheet over the years, the prolifera-\ntion of lawyers, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs, along with a\nsteadily increasing number of investments, has prevented this from\nhappening. Ironically, the actual definitive documents have become\nmore standard over time. Whether it is the Internet age that has\nspread information across the ecosystem or clients growing tired of\npaying legal bills, there are more similarities in the documents today\nthan ever before. As a result, we can lend you our experience in how\nventure financings are usually done. The good news is once you've\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"3\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet\" -->\n\nnegotiated the term sheet, you are done with the hard part. As a\nresult, that's where we are going to focus our energy in this book.\n\nThroughout this book we will cover not only the what and the\nhow, but also the why things work as they do.

            "summary": "Chapter 4, the Introduction \"The Art of the Term Sheet,\" uses the seminal AR&D/DEC story to show how simple investment proposals evolved into today’s roughly eight‑page term sheets filled with protective provisions. The authors emphasize that despite the volume of boilerplate and lawyerly minutiae, two dimensions dominate every financing negotiation: economics (who owns what) and control (who can make or block key decisions). The chapter also frames the practical landscape an entrepreneur will face—VC firm hierarchies, angels and super angels, syndicates and leads, and the critical role of a knowledgeable lawyer—and explains that once a term sheet is agreed, the hardest part of the deal process is largely over.\n\nBuilding on fundraising advice, the chapter moves from high‑level theory to operating reality: how rounds are named (and often misnamed), how syndicates form and who usually leads them, what to expect in diligence, and what materials (executive summary, concise deck, demo) actually matter to investors. It offers tactical counsel—create competition among VCs, align timelines, be strategic about disclosures, choose an experienced lawyer, expect title inflation inside VC firms, and prefer substance (demo, team, market) over polished but empty materials—reinforcing that process knowledge and negotiation focus on economics and control will serve entrepreneurs best.",

All of the participants were to\nblame, and ignorance of what really mattered in the negotiation\nkept things going much longer than was necessary. We talked about\nwhat to do and, at the risk of giving away super-top-secret venture\ncapital magic tricks, decided to write a blog series on Brad's blog\n(Feld Thoughts-www.feld.com) that deconstructed a venture capital\nterm sheet and explained each section.\n\nThat blog series was the inspiration for this book. The next few\nchapters cover the most frequently discussed terms in a venture capi-\ntal term sheet. Many venture capitalists (VCs) love to negotiate hard\non every term as though the health of their children depended on\nthem getting the terms just right. Sometimes this is inexperience on\nthe part of the VC; often, it's just a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe specific language that we refer to is from actual term sheets.\nIn addition to describing and explaining the specific terms, we give\nyou examples of what to focus on and implications from the perspec-\ntives of the company, VCs, and entrepreneurs.",
            "summary": "Chapter 5 builds directly on the book’s mission (introduced in the Foreword and Preface) to demystify term‑sheet language by laying out the two meta‑principles that govern virtually every VC negotiation: economics and control. It reviews the economic levers—price/valuation, liquidation preference, option pool sizing, warrants and bridge financing, pay‑to‑play, vesting and exercise periods, dividends, redemption rights, and antidilution mechanics (full ratchet vs. weighted average and broad vs. narrow bases)—and explains how each affects investor returns and founder dilution. The chapter also covers control levers: board composition, protective provisions, conversion and automatic conversion thresholds, class voting dynamics, and the practical risks of poorly drafted consent/trigger terms. Practical entrepreneur‑side guidance runs through the chapter (e.g., prepare an option budget, avoid unnecessary warrants, prefer balanced vesting and double‑trigger acceleration, equalize automatic conversion thresholds across series, and resist vague adverse‑change redemption clauses). \n\nThis chapter sharpens the themes introduced in the Introduction (Chapter 4) about how term sheets evolved from simple offers into dense, lawyerly documents by showing which clauses materially matter and which are often negotiation theater. It emphasizes how many term‑sheet disputes reduce to fights over economics or control, and it gives entrepreneurs concrete negotiating strategies and cautionary examples (antidilution math, board seat balance, investor voting mechanics, and conditions precedent that mask deal escape hatches). The chapter closes by reminding readers that term sheets are usually nonbinding and that entrepreneurs should watch for clauses investors make binding (no‑shop, legal fees, governing law) while reserving the right to confirm understandings in definitive agreements.",

Building on the book’s earlier discussion of why term sheets exist (Chapter 4) and the two meta‑principles of every negotiation—economics and control (Chapter 5)—the authors focus on the timing and specificity of key deal terms. The single most important tactical takeaway is: if the term sheet contains a no‑shop clause that restricts you from soliciting other investors, insist that any material employment and management terms (CEO role, compensation, equity vesting, change‑in‑control protections, board seats, etc.) be spelled out before you sign. A VC’s refusal to commit to these basics early is a clear red flag because a signed no‑shop gives them leverage while you remain exposed.\n\nThe chapter also warns that many idiosyncratic and punitive provisions have been used in the past—if you can dream it, someone has probably tried it—so read the contract carefully. It underscores an important process point emphasized earlier: a signed term sheet is not the same as a closed deal. Boilerplate paragraphs and odd conditions can impose obligations or contingencies that change the economics or control consequences you thought were agreed. Entrepreneurs should therefore use counsel, push for clarity on critical items up front, and treat the term sheet as the beginning of a binding negotiation path rather than the finish line.",

Building on the book’s earlier explanations of why term sheets exist (Chapter 4) and the two meta‑principles—economics and control (Chapter 5)—the chapter argues that entrepreneurs should default to transparency. It explains that routine delivery of budgets, financial statements, and periodic reporting is both a reasonable expectation from investors and a useful discipline for the company. The authors warn that if a founder cannot commit to these basic reporting obligations, they should not take outside capital, because information rights are a fundamental part of how investors exercise control and monitor their economics.\n\nThe chapter is also pragmatic about tradeoffs. It counsels entrepreneurs to keep reporting obligations sensible and operationally feasible so that compliance does not become a crippling burden on a small team. At the same time, it recommends protecting sensitive details with a confidentiality clause if the founder is concerned about competitive exposure. In short, the entrepreneur’s perspective presented here treats information rights as a low‑cost, high‑value governance tool: easy to grant, important to investors, useful to founders, and negotiable in scope and frequency to preserve founder bandwidth and company confidentiality.",

The authors situate the ROFR in the context of changing market realities: historically founders were tightly restricted from selling until investors could exit, but the growth of secondary markets and longer private company life cycles have shifted practices and made selective, controlled secondary sales more common.\n\nThe entrepreneurial recommendation is pragmatic: entrepreneurs generally shouldn't fight ROFRs because they help preserve a controlled shareholder base, which benefits the company and most shareholders, and the clause gives management visibility and decision authority over private transfers (important amid greater SEC scrutiny of private ownership rules). That said, entrepreneurs should negotiate definitions and scope—limit transfer rights to \"major investors\" (and define that term) or condition rights on participation in subsequent rounds—so that ROFRs protect the company without granting blanket veto power to minor shareholders.",

It reinforces the negotiating posture developed earlier (Chapters 6–8): be forward-looking and pragmatic, get necessary protections in place for investors, but also protect founders’ ability to live their lives and access small amounts of liquidity.\n\nThe chapter then turns to co-sale/ROFR mechanics (building on Chapter 9): entrepreneurs should expect that investors will not surrender co-sale clauses, but should nonetheless ask for a floor or exceptions so that small, bona fide personal sales (e.g., to buy a house) are not unduly blocked. It clarifies that a ROFR that uses the valuation from a bona fide outside offer as the purchase price is an acceptable protection for investors, whereas an effective exclusion (a blanket veto that prevents reasonable founder sales) is not. The practical takeaway: accept core protections that preserve investor economics and control, but negotiate clear, limited exceptions and valuation rules so founders retain minimal liquidity and freedom.",

A term sheet will almost always contain a summary\ncap table, which we describe in this chapter. You, your prospective\ninvestors, or occasionally your lawyers will generate a more detailed\ncap table.\n\nThe cap table summarizes who owns what part of the company\nbefore and after the financing. This is one area that some founders,\nespecially those who have not been exposed in the past to cap table\nmath, are often uncomfortable with. It's extremely important for\nfounders to understand exactly who owns what part of a company\nand what the implications are in a potential funding round.\n\nNormally when you initially set up the company, 100% will be\nallocated to the founders and employees, with a specific number of\nshares allocated to each individual. The question \"What will I own\nif a venture capitalist invests X in my company at a Y valuation?\" is\nrarely simple. To answer it, you need to be able to generate a cap\ntable to truly analyze the deal presented by a particular term sheet.\nFollowing is a model to work from with a typical example.\n\nLet's assume the following:\n\n2 million shares held by founders before the VC invests\n$10 million pre-money valuation\n$5 million investment by the VC\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"103\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"104\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->\n\nIn this example, the post-money valuation is $15 million ($10 mil-\nlion pre-money + $5 million investment). Consequently, the VCs\nown 33.33% of the company after the financing ($5 million invest-\nment/$15 million post-money valuation). This should be pretty\nstraightforward so far.\n\nNow, assume the term sheet includes a new employee option\npool of 20% on a post-money basis. Remember that this means that\nafter the financing, there will be an unallocated option pool equal\nto 20% of the company.\n\nAlthough the post-money valuation remains the same ($15 mil-\nlion), the requirement for a 20% option pool will have a significant\nimpact on the ownership of the founders. Per the cap table, you\ncan see how we calculate the percentage ownership for each class\nof owner, along with the price per share of the preferred stock. To\nstart, we've filled in the known numbers and now have to solve for\nthe unknowns (A, B, C, D, and E).\n\nFirst, let's solve for A, the founders' ownership percentage: A =\n100% minus the VC percentage minus the employee pool percent-\nage, or 100% - 33.33% - 20% = 46.67%. Given that we know that the\n2 million founders' shares represent 46.67% of the company, we can\ndetermine that the total shares outstanding (E = 2 million/ 0.4667)\nare 4,285,408. Now, if there are 4,285,408 shares outstanding, deter-\nmining the number of shares in the employee pool becomes B = E\n*0.20 or 857,081.\n\nThe same math applies for C, the number of shares of preferred\nstock the VCs have. C = E * 0.3333 or 1,428,326. Since $5 million\nbought 1,428,326 shares of preferred stock, then the price per share\nof preferred stock (D = $5 million/1,428,326) is $3.50 per share.\n\nFinally, always check your calculation. Since we know we have a\n$10 million pre-money valuation, then the shares prior to the financ-\ning (2 million founders' shares plus the 20% option pool) times the\nprice per share should equal $10 million. If you do this math, you'll\n\n\n<table>\n<caption>Example Capitalization Table</caption>\n<tr>\n<th>Class</th>\n<th>Shares</th>\n<th>Preferred Price</th>\n<th>Valuation</th>\n<th>Percentage</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Founders</td>\n<td>2,000,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Employee pool</td>\n<td>B</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Venture investors</td>\n<td>C</td>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>$5,000,000</td>\n<td>33.33%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>E</td>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>$15,000,000</td>\n<td>100%</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"105\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"The Capitalization Table\" -->\n\nsee that (2 million + 857,081) * $3.50 = $9,999,783.50. Oops, we are\noff by $216.50, which represents 62 shares (well, 61.857 shares).\n\nWhile this is close enough for an example, it's not close enough\nfor most VCs, or for most lawyers for that matter. And it shouldn't\nbe close enough for you. That's why most cap tables have two addi-\ntional significant digits (or fractional shares)-the rounding to the\nnearest share doesn't happen during intermediate steps but only at\nthe very end.\n\nAs the entrepreneur, you shouldn't blindly rely on legal counsel\nto generate these documents. There are a lot of good lawyers out\nthere with poor math skills, and the cap table can get messed up\nwhen left in the hands of the lawyers. Although some get it right, it's\nyour responsibility as the entrepreneur to make sure you understand\nyour cap table. This will be especially helpful at times when you want\nto expand the employee option pool and you are eloquent in front\nof your board of directors explaining the ramifications.",
            "summary": "This chapter takes the book’s earlier bargaining and control concepts and applies them to a concrete, indispensable tool: the capitalization table (cap table). Using a simple numerical example (2,000,000 founder shares, $10M pre-money, $5M new investment, 20% post-money option pool), it shows how to convert term‑sheet headline numbers into share counts, price-per-share, and exact ownership percentages. The key calculation is solving for total shares outstanding given a post‑money ownership split, then deriving the employee pool shares, investor shares, and preferred price. The chapter also flags a practical but important detail: rounding and fractional shares matter—intermediate rounding errors can produce discrepancies that VCs and lawyers will not accept, so cap tables should carry extra precision and only round at the last step.\n\nBuilding on prior chapters, the chapter stresses that founders must own this analysis—not outsource it blindly to counsel—because the cap table determines dilution, voting power, and economic outcomes. It emphasizes how an option pool sized on a post‑money basis dilutes founders (not investors) and shows the routine algebra founders need to check any term sheet: compute founder percent = 100% - VC% - pool%, solve for total shares = founder shares / founder percent, then compute pool and VC share counts and price per share. The takeaway is operational and strategic: understand the cap table math, verify that share counts multiply back to the stated pre- and post-money valuations, and be prepared to explain and negotiate the cap table consequences at the close.",

However, there is one\nother type of financing, often used at the seed stage, called a con-\nvertible debt financing. In fact, many angel investors will invest only\nwith this structure.\n\nConvertible debt is just that: debt. It's a loan. The loan will con-\nvert to equity (preferred stock, usually) at such time as another\nround is raised. The conversion usually includes some sort of dis-\ncount on the price to the future round.\n\nFor example, assume you raise $500,000 in convertible debt\nfrom angels with a 20% discount to the next round, and six months\nlater a venture capitalist (VC) offers to lead a Series A round of a\n$1 million investment at $1 a share. Your financing will actually be\nfor $1.5 million total, although the VCs will get 1 million Series A\nshares ($1 million at $1 per share) and the angels will get 625,000\nSeries A shares ($500,000 at $0.80 per share). The discount is appro-\npriate, as your early investors want some reward for investing before\nthe full Series A financing round comes together.\n\nIn this chapter, we cover the arguments for and against using\nconvertible debt. We then go through the terms in a convertible\ndebt deal, including the discount, valuation caps, interest rate, con-\nversion mechanics, conversion in a sale of the company, warrants,\nand other terms. We briefly cover the differences between early-stage\nand late-stage dynamics and finish up with an example of when con-\nvertible debt could be dangerous to use.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"107\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"108\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->",

It defines a convertible note as a loan that typically converts into preferred equity at the next qualifying financing, often at a discount to the new round price. The chapter walks through key commercial terms — discount, valuation cap, interest, maturity and automatic conversion triggers, qualified financing thresholds, amendment/consent mechanics, and the treatment of notes in an acquisition — and explains how each term affects dilution, timing, and control. It also covers less common add-ons such as warrants (including term length, merger treatment, and original issue discount accounting), and contrasts convertible notes with newer standardized instruments (SAFE, KISS), highlighting trade-offs (maturity and leverage, investor protections like pro rata, and simplicity). Finally, it distinguishes traditional bridge/late-stage notes from modern seed notes and flags scenarios where convertible debt can create serious risks (debt power, stalled conversion, misaligned incentives).",

      "overall_summary": "Venture Deals is a practical, inside‑out guide to how venture capital financings actually work, aimed at entrepreneurs, their lawyers, and new entrants to the startup finance ecosystem. The book opens by mapping the players — founders, angels, VCs, syndicates, lawyers and mentors — and explains their differing motivations and incentives. Using the historical AR&D/DEC example and decades of deal experience, the authors show how simple investment letters evolved into today’s multi‑page term sheets and argue that every negotiation reduces to two core levers: economics (who gets what) and control (who makes or blocks decisions).\n\nFrom that framing the text walks readers through the anatomy of term sheets: valuation and price mechanics, liquidation preferences and participation, option pool sizing, vesting, dilution protections (antidilution), board composition and protective provisions. Interleaved throughout are entrepreneur‑focused sidebars and tactical advice: when to insist on written employment terms, how to handle no‑shop clauses, the practical meaning of information and registration rights, and sensible approaches to co‑sale and ROFR provisions. The authors emphasize that a signed term sheet starts the binding negotiation path rather than completes it and caution founders to watch for provisions that are accidentally made binding.\n\nThe book also covers the tools founders most need: how to build and validate a capitalization table, how convertible debt (notes and SAFEs) works and where it can create pitfalls, and the essential legal hygiene every founder must understand (employment arrangements, 83(b) elections, corporate form selection, indemnification and D&O insurance). Practical numeric examples and cap‑table algebra demystify dilution math and show how post‑money option pools dilute founders, not incoming investors.\n\nFinally, Venture Deals steps back to place startups in context with a short manifesto on ecosystem building (the Boulder Thesis): entrepreneurship clusters because of real, local advantages and succeed best when entrepreneur‑led, long‑term, inclusive, and activity‑driven. Overall, the book combines deal mechanics, negotiation strategy, legal reminders and community wisdom into a single handbook that helps readers negotiate smarter, avoid common traps, and align incentives for long‑term company building.",

I was working for three experienced venture capitalists\nin a small firm called Euclid Partners, where I ended up spending\nthe first 10 years of my VC career. One of those three partners,\nBliss McCrum, peeked his head into my office (I had an office in\nRockefeller Center at age 25) and said to me, \"Can you model out\na financing for XYZ Company at a $9 million pre-money, raising\n$3 million, with an unissued option pool of 10%?\" and then went\nback to the big office in the rear he shared with the other founding\npartner, Milton Pappas.\n\nI sat at my desk and started thinking about the request. I\nunderstood the \"raising $3 million\" bit. I thought I could figure\nout the \"unissued option pool of 10%\" bit. But what the hell was\n\"pre-money\"? I had never heard that term. This was almost a decade\nbefore Netscape and Internet search so searching online for it wasn't\nan option. After spending ten minutes getting up the courage, I\nwalked back to that big office, peeked my head in, and said to Bliss,\n\"Can you explain pre-money to me?\"\n\nThus began my 31-year education in venture capital that is still\ngoing on as I write this.\n\nThe venture capital business was a cottage industry back in 1985,\nwith club deals and a language all of its own. A cynic would say it was\ndesigned this way to be opaque to everyone other than the VCs so that\nthey would have all the leverage in negotiations with entrepreneurs.\nI don't entirely buy that narrative. I think the VC business grew up in\na few small offices in Boston, New York, and San Francisco, and the\ndozens-maybe as many as a hundred-of main participants, along\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"xiii\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"xiv Foreword\" -->\n\nwith their lawyers, came up with structures that made sense to them.\nThey then developed a shorthand so that they could communicate\namong themselves.\n\nBut whatever the origin story was, the language of venture deals\nis foreign to many and remains opaque and confusing to this day.\nThis works to the advantage of industry insiders and to the disadvan-\ntage of those who are new to startups and venture capital.\n\nIn the early 2000s, after I wound down my first venture capital\nfirm, Flatiron Partners, and before we started USV, I started blogging.\nOne of my goals with my AVC blog (at www.avc.com) was to bring\ntransparency to this opaque world that I had been inhabiting for\nalmost 20 years. I was joined in this blogging thing by Brad Feld, a\nfriend and frequent coinvestor. Club investing has not gone away\nand that's a good thing. By reading AVC and Feld Thoughts regu-\nlarly, an entrepreneur could get up to speed on startups and venture\ncapital. Brad and I received a tremendous amount of positive feed-\nback on our efforts to bring transparency to the venture capital busi-\nness so we kept doing it, and now if you search for something like\n\"participating preferred\" you will find posts written by both me and\nBrad on that first search results page.\n\nBrad and his partner Jason Mendelson (a recovering startup law-\nyer turned VC) took things a step further and wrote a book called\nVenture Deals back in 2011. It has turned into a classic and is now on\nits Third Edition. If Venture Deals had been around in 1985, I would\nnot have had to admit to Bliss that I had no idea what pre-money\nmeant.\n\nIf there is a guidebook to navigating the mysterious and confusing\nlanguage of venture capital and venture capital financing structures,\nit is Venture Deals.

The Foreword (by Fred Wilson) begins with a personal anecdote about encountering the term “pre‑money,” highlighting how VC jargon and structures evolved among a small group of practitioners and have remained obscure to outsiders. The Preface explains the book’s origins (the Term Sheet Series blog posts) and outlines the authors’ intent to provide a practical, balanced guide that covers the players, the fundraising process, the specific terms in term sheets (economics, control, and miscellaneous), convertible debt, crowdfunding, VC firm operations, negotiation tactics, acquisition letters of intent, and common legal issues. It also notes the inclusion of an entrepreneur’s perspective (Matt Blumberg) to keep the guide grounded in real founder experience.\n\nBuilding on Chapter 1’s mapping of the VC ecosystem and its participants, this chapter explicitly positions the rest of the book as a toolkit: it will translate the roles and motivations described earlier into actionable knowledge about how deals are structured and negotiated. The Preface describes the structure of the book, signals where readers will find deep dives (e.g., term categories, negotiation, financing stages), and highlights new topics for this edition such as crowdfunding and practical firm‑level incentives. Overall, this chapter moves the reader from understanding who the players are (Chapter 1) to learning how those players interact contractually and strategically in fundraising and exits.",

          "chapter_title": "Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet\n\n0\nne of the first famous venture capital investments was Digital\nEquipment Corporation (DEC). In 1957, American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation (AR&D), one of the first venture capital\nfirms, invested $70,000 in DEC. When DEC went public in 1968, this\ninvestment was worth over $355 million, or a return of over 5,000\ntimes the invested capital. AR&D's investment in DEC was one of the\noriginal venture capital home runs.\n\nIn 1957, the venture capital industry was just being created. At the\ntime, the investor community in the United States was uninterested\nin investing in computer companies, as the last wave of computer-\nrelated startups had performed poorly and even large companies\nwere having difficulty making money in the computer business. We\ncan envision the frustration of DEC's cofounders, Ken Olson and\nHarlan Anderson, as the investors they talked to rejected them\nand their fledgling idea for a business. We can also imagine their\njoy when Georges Doriot, the founder of American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation, offered to fund them. After a number\nof conversations and meetings, Doriot sent Olson and Anderson a\nletter expressing his interest in investing, along with his proposed\nterms. Today, this document is called the term sheet.\n\nNow, imagine what that term sheet looked like. There are three\ndifferent possibilities. The first is that it was a typed one-page let-\nter that said, \"We would like to invest $70,000 in your company\nand buy 78 percent of it.\" The next is that it was two pages of legal\nterms that basically said, \"We would like to invest $70,000 in your\ncompany and buy 78 percent of it.\" Or it could have been an eight-\npage typed document that had all kinds of protective provisions, vesting\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"1\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"2\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->\n\narrangements, drag-along rights, and Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission (SEC) registration rights.\n\nOur guess is that it was not the third option. Over the past 50\nyears, the art of the term sheet has evolved and expanded, reaching\nits current eight (or so) page literary masterpiece. These eight pages\ncontain a lot more than \"We'd like to invest $X in your company\nand get Y% of it,\" but, as you'll learn, there really are only two key\nthings that matter in the actual term sheet negotiation-economics\nand control.\n\nIn DEC's case, by owning 78% of the company, AR&D effec-\ntively had control of the company. And the price was clearly\ndefined-$70,000 bought 78% of the company, resulting in a $90,000\npost-money valuation.\n\nToday's venture capital investments have many more nuances.\nIndividual venture capitalists (VCs) usually end up owning less than\n50 percent of the company, so they don't have effective voting con-\ntrol but often negotiate provisions that give them control over major\ndecisions by the company. Many companies end up with multiple\nventure capitalists who invest in the company at different points in\ntime, resulting in different ownership percentages, varying rights,\nand diverging motivations. Founders don't always stay with the com-\npany through the exit and, in some cases, they end up leaving rela-\ntively early in the life of a company for a variety of reasons. Compa-\nnies fail, so venture capitalists have gotten much more focused on\nprotecting themselves for the downside as well as participating in the\nupside. Governance issues are always complex, especially when you\nhave a lot of people sitting around the negotiating table.\n\nWhile it would be desirable to do venture capital deals with a\nsimple agreement on price, a handshake, and a short legal agree-\nment, this rarely happens. And while there have been plenty of\nattempts to standardize the term sheet over the years, the prolifera-\ntion of lawyers, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs, along with a\nsteadily increasing number of investments, has prevented this from\nhappening. Ironically, the actual definitive documents have become\nmore standard over time. Whether it is the Internet age that has\nspread information across the ecosystem or clients growing tired of\npaying legal bills, there are more similarities in the documents today\nthan ever before. As a result, we can lend you our experience in how\nventure financings are usually done. The good news is once you've\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"3\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet\" -->\n\nnegotiated the term sheet, you are done with the hard part. As a\nresult, that's where we are going to focus our energy in this book.\n\nThroughout this book we will cover not only the what and the\nhow, but also the why things work as they do. Let's begin our explora-\ntion of venture capital financings by discussing the various players\ninvolved.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer and Venture Capitalist, Third Edition By Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson Copyright @ 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\" -->",
          "summary": "Chapter 4, the Introduction \"The Art of the Term Sheet,\" uses the seminal AR&D/DEC story to show how simple investment proposals evolved into today’s roughly eight‑page term sheets filled with protective provisions. The authors emphasize that despite the volume of boilerplate and lawyerly minutiae, two dimensions dominate every financing negotiation: economics (who owns what) and control (who can make or block key decisions). The chapter also frames the practical landscape an entrepreneur will face—VC firm hierarchies, angels and super angels, syndicates and leads, and the critical role of a knowledgeable lawyer—and explains that once a term sheet is agreed, the hardest part of the deal process is largely over.\n\nBuilding on fundraising advice, the chapter moves from high‑level theory to operating reality: how rounds are named (and often misnamed), how syndicates form and who usually leads them, what to expect in diligence, and what materials (executive summary, concise deck, demo) actually matter to investors. It offers tactical counsel—create competition among VCs, align timelines, be strategic about disclosures, choose an experienced lawyer, expect title inflation inside VC firms, and prefer substance (demo, team, market) over polished but empty materials—reinforcing that process knowledge and negotiation focus on economics and control will serve entrepreneurs best.",

All of the participants were to\nblame, and ignorance of what really mattered in the negotiation\nkept things going much longer than was necessary. We talked about\nwhat to do and, at the risk of giving away super-top-secret venture\ncapital magic tricks, decided to write a blog series on Brad's blog\n(Feld Thoughts-www.feld.com) that deconstructed a venture capital\nterm sheet and explained each section.\n\nThat blog series was the inspiration for this book. The next few\nchapters cover the most frequently discussed terms in a venture capi-\ntal term sheet. Many venture capitalists (VCs) love to negotiate hard\non every term as though the health of their children depended on\nthem getting the terms just right. Sometimes this is inexperience on\nthe part of the VC; often, it's just a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe specific language that we refer to is from actual term sheets.\nIn addition to describing and explaining the specific terms, we give\nyou examples of what to focus on and implications from the perspec-\ntives of the company, VCs, and entrepreneurs.",
          "summary": "Chapter 5 builds directly on the book’s mission (introduced in the Foreword and Preface) to demystify term‑sheet language by laying out the two meta‑principles that govern virtually every VC negotiation: economics and control. It reviews the economic levers—price/valuation, liquidation preference, option pool sizing, warrants and bridge financing, pay‑to‑play, vesting and exercise periods, dividends, redemption rights, and antidilution mechanics (full ratchet vs. weighted average and broad vs. narrow bases)—and explains how each affects investor returns and founder dilution. The chapter also covers control levers: board composition, protective provisions, conversion and automatic conversion thresholds, class voting dynamics, and the practical risks of poorly drafted consent/trigger terms. Practical entrepreneur‑side guidance runs through the chapter (e.g., prepare an option budget, avoid unnecessary warrants, prefer balanced vesting and double‑trigger acceleration, equalize automatic conversion thresholds across series, and resist vague adverse‑change redemption clauses). \n\nThis chapter sharpens the themes introduced in the Introduction (Chapter 4) about how term sheets evolved from simple offers into dense, lawyerly documents by showing which clauses materially matter and which are often negotiation theater. It emphasizes how many term‑sheet disputes reduce to fights over economics or control, and it gives entrepreneurs concrete negotiating strategies and cautionary examples (antidilution math, board seat balance, investor voting mechanics, and conditions precedent that mask deal escape hatches). The chapter closes by reminding readers that term sheets are usually nonbinding and that entrepreneurs should watch for clauses investors make binding (no‑shop, legal fees, governing law) while reserving the right to confirm understandings in definitive agreements.",

Building on the book’s earlier discussion of why term sheets exist (Chapter 4) and the two meta‑principles of every negotiation—economics and control (Chapter 5)—the authors focus on the timing and specificity of key deal terms. The single most important tactical takeaway is: if the term sheet contains a no‑shop clause that restricts you from soliciting other investors, insist that any material employment and management terms (CEO role, compensation, equity vesting, change‑in‑control protections, board seats, etc.) be spelled out before you sign. A VC’s refusal to commit to these basics early is a clear red flag because a signed no‑shop gives them leverage while you remain exposed.\n\nThe chapter also warns that many idiosyncratic and punitive provisions have been used in the past—if you can dream it, someone has probably tried it—so read the contract carefully. It underscores an important process point emphasized earlier: a signed term sheet is not the same as a closed deal. Boilerplate paragraphs and odd conditions can impose obligations or contingencies that change the economics or control consequences you thought were agreed. Entrepreneurs should therefore use counsel, push for clarity on critical items up front, and treat the term sheet as the beginning of a binding negotiation path rather than the finish line.",

It explains that routine delivery of budgets, financial statements, and periodic reporting is both a reasonable expectation from investors and a useful discipline for the company. The authors warn that if a founder cannot commit to these basic reporting obligations, they should not take outside capital, because information rights are a fundamental part of how investors exercise control and monitor their economics.\n\nThe chapter is also pragmatic about tradeoffs. It counsels entrepreneurs to keep reporting obligations sensible and operationally feasible so that compliance does not become a crippling burden on a small team. At the same time, it recommends protecting sensitive details with a confidentiality clause if the founder is concerned about competitive exposure. In short, the entrepreneur’s perspective presented here treats information rights as a low‑cost, high‑value governance tool: easy to grant, important to investors, useful to founders, and negotiable in scope and frequency to preserve founder bandwidth and company confidentiality.",

          "summary": "This chapter applies the book's earlier meta‑principles—especially the control dimension from Chapter 5—to a specific, common contractual mechanism: the restriction on sales or right of first refusal (ROFR) on common stock. It explains typical ROFR language, why companies often prefer placing the restriction in the bylaws (one centralized place that is hard to miss), and the practical mechanics whereby if the company declines to buy offered shares it can assign the right to investors. The authors situate the ROFR in the context of changing market realities: historically founders were tightly restricted from selling until investors could exit, but the growth of secondary markets and longer private company life cycles have shifted practices and made selective, controlled secondary sales more common.\n\nThe entrepreneurial recommendation is pragmatic: entrepreneurs generally shouldn't fight ROFRs because they help preserve a controlled shareholder base, which benefits the company and most shareholders, and the clause gives management visibility and decision authority over private transfers (important amid greater SEC scrutiny of private ownership rules). That said, entrepreneurs should negotiate definitions and scope—limit transfer rights to \"major investors\" (and define that term) or condition rights on participation in subsequent rounds—so that ROFRs protect the company without granting blanket veto power to minor shareholders.",

          "summary": "This short but practical chapter puts the entrepreneur’s stance center stage on two recurring contract items: employee/founder proprietary information and inventions agreements (PIIA/IP assignment) and investor co-sale/ROFR-style restraints on founder stock sales. Building on the book’s prior explanation of why term sheets exist (Chapter 4) and the two meta-principles of economics and control (Chapter 5), the chapter advises entrepreneurs to accept reasonable company protections—having all employees and founders sign PIIAs before outside financing—while negotiating limited, sensible carve-outs for truly unrelated outside work. It reinforces the negotiating posture developed earlier (Chapters 6–8): be forward-looking and pragmatic, get necessary protections in place for investors, but also protect founders’ ability to live their lives and access small amounts of liquidity.\n\nThe chapter then turns to co-sale/ROFR mechanics (building on Chapter 9): entrepreneurs should expect that investors will not surrender co-sale clauses, but should nonetheless ask for a floor or exceptions so that small, bona fide personal sales (e.g., to buy a house) are not unduly blocked. It clarifies that a ROFR that uses the valuation from a bona fide outside offer as the purchase price is an acceptable protection for investors, whereas an effective exclusion (a blanket veto that prevents reasonable founder sales) is not. The practical takeaway: accept core protections that preserve investor economics and control, but negotiate clear, limited exceptions and valuation rules so founders retain minimal liquidity and freedom.",

The chapter then walks through three routine provisions — the no-shop agreement, indemnification for directors and investors, and the assignment clause — explaining their typical language, why VCs want them, and what entrepreneurs should realistically expect to negotiate.\n\nBuilding on earlier meta‑principles (economics and control) and the negotiation posture advocated in prior chapters, the authors emphasize practical tips: limit no-shop periods (typically 30–60 days), use the clause to test a VC’s commitment rather than overinvest legal effort, accept indemnification (and plan to buy D&O insurance as rounds progress), and allow limited assignment by VCs while guarding against loopholes that would let transferees escape obligations.

          "chapter_title": "The Capitalization Table\n\nN.\now that we've worked through all of the specific clauses in the\nterm sheet, let's go through how a typical capitalization table (cap\ntable) works. A term sheet will almost always contain a summary\ncap table, which we describe in this chapter. You, your prospective\ninvestors, or occasionally your lawyers will generate a more detailed\ncap table.\n\nThe cap table summarizes who owns what part of the company\nbefore and after the financing. This is one area that some founders,\nespecially those who have not been exposed in the past to cap table\nmath, are often uncomfortable with. It's extremely important for\nfounders to understand exactly who owns what part of a company\nand what the implications are in a potential funding round.\n\nNormally when you initially set up the company, 100% will be\nallocated to the founders and employees, with a specific number of\nshares allocated to each individual. The question \"What will I own\nif a venture capitalist invests X in my company at a Y valuation?\" is\nrarely simple. To answer it, you need to be able to generate a cap\ntable to truly analyze the deal presented by a particular term sheet.\nFollowing is a model to work from with a typical example.\n\nLet's assume the following:\n\n2 million shares held by founders before the VC invests\n$10 million pre-money valuation\n$5 million investment by the VC\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"103\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"104\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->\n\nIn this example, the post-money valuation is $15 million ($10 mil-\nlion pre-money + $5 million investment). Consequently, the VCs\nown 33.33% of the company after the financing ($5 million invest-\nment/$15 million post-money valuation). This should be pretty\nstraightforward so far.\n\nNow, assume the term sheet includes a new employee option\npool of 20% on a post-money basis. Remember that this means that\nafter the financing, there will be an unallocated option pool equal\nto 20% of the company.\n\nAlthough the post-money valuation remains the same ($15 mil-\nlion), the requirement for a 20% option pool will have a significant\nimpact on the ownership of the founders. Per the cap table, you\ncan see how we calculate the percentage ownership for each class\nof owner, along with the price per share of the preferred stock. To\nstart, we've filled in the known numbers and now have to solve for\nthe unknowns (A, B, C, D, and E).\n\nFirst, let's solve for A, the founders' ownership percentage: A =\n100% minus the VC percentage minus the employee pool percent-\nage, or 100% - 33.33% - 20% = 46.67%. Given that we know that the\n2 million founders' shares represent 46.67% of the company, we can\ndetermine that the total shares outstanding (E = 2 million/ 0.4667)\nare 4,285,408. Now, if there are 4,285,408 shares outstanding, deter-\nmining the number of shares in the employee pool becomes B = E\n*0.20 or 857,081.\n\nThe same math applies for C, the number of shares of preferred\nstock the VCs have. C = E * 0.3333 or 1,428,326. Since $5 million\nbought 1,428,326 shares of preferred stock, then the price per share\nof preferred stock (D = $5 million/1,428,326) is $3.50 per share.\n\nFinally, always check your calculation. Since we know we have a\n$10 million pre-money valuation, then the shares prior to the financ-\ning (2 million founders' shares plus the 20% option pool) times the\nprice per share should equal $10 million. If you do this math, you'll\n\n\n<table>\n<caption>Example Capitalization Table</caption>\n<tr>\n<th>Class</th>\n<th>Shares</th>\n<th>Preferred Price</th>\n<th>Valuation</th>\n<th>Percentage</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Founders</td>\n<td>2,000,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Employee pool</td>\n<td>B</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Venture investors</td>\n<td>C</td>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>$5,000,000</td>\n<td>33.33%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>E</td>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>$15,000,000</td>\n<td>100%</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"105\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"The Capitalization Table\" -->\n\nsee that (2 million + 857,081) * $3.50 = $9,999,783.50. Oops, we are\noff by $216.50, which represents 62 shares (well, 61.857 shares).\n\nWhile this is close enough for an example, it's not close enough\nfor most VCs, or for most lawyers for that matter. And it shouldn't\nbe close enough for you. That's why most cap tables have two addi-\ntional significant digits (or fractional shares)-the rounding to the\nnearest share doesn't happen during intermediate steps but only at\nthe very end.\n\nAs the entrepreneur, you shouldn't blindly rely on legal counsel\nto generate these documents. There are a lot of good lawyers out\nthere with poor math skills, and the cap table can get messed up\nwhen left in the hands of the lawyers. Although some get it right, it's\nyour responsibility as the entrepreneur to make sure you understand\nyour cap table. This will be especially helpful at times when you want\nto expand the employee option pool and you are eloquent in front\nof your board of directors explaining the ramifications.",
          "summary": "This chapter takes the book’s earlier bargaining and control concepts and applies them to a concrete, indispensable tool: the capitalization table (cap table). Using a simple numerical example (2,000,000 founder shares, $10M pre-money, $5M new investment, 20% post-money option pool), it shows how to convert term‑sheet headline numbers into share counts, price-per-share, and exact ownership percentages. The key calculation is solving for total shares outstanding given a post‑money ownership split, then deriving the employee pool shares, investor shares, and preferred price. The chapter also flags a practical but important detail: rounding and fractional shares matter—intermediate rounding errors can produce discrepancies that VCs and lawyers will not accept, so cap tables should carry extra precision and only round at the last step.\n\nBuilding on prior chapters, the chapter stresses that founders must own this analysis—not outsource it blindly to counsel—because the cap table determines dilution, voting power, and economic outcomes. It emphasizes how an option pool sized on a post‑money basis dilutes founders (not investors) and shows the routine algebra founders need to check any term sheet: compute founder percent = 100% - VC% - pool%, solve for total shares = founder shares / founder percent, then compute pool and VC share counts and price per share. The takeaway is operational and strategic: understand the cap table math, verify that share counts multiply back to the stated pre- and post-money valuations, and be prepared to explain and negotiate the cap table consequences at the close.",

          "chapter_title": "Convertible Debt\n\nI,\nn the past few chapters we've gone through, in detail, the terms\nin a typical venture capital equity financing. However, there is one\nother type of financing, often used at the seed stage, called a con-\nvertible debt financing. In fact, many angel investors will invest only\nwith this structure.\n\nConvertible debt is just that: debt. It's a loan. The loan will con-\nvert to equity (preferred stock, usually) at such time as another\nround is raised. The conversion usually includes some sort of dis-\ncount on the price to the future round.\n\nFor example, assume you raise $500,000 in convertible debt\nfrom angels with a 20% discount to the next round, and six months\nlater a venture capitalist (VC) offers to lead a Series A round of a\n$1 million investment at $1 a share. Your financing will actually be\nfor $1.5 million total, although the VCs will get 1 million Series A\nshares ($1 million at $1 per share) and the angels will get 625,000\nSeries A shares ($500,000 at $0.80 per share). The discount is appro-\npriate, as your early investors want some reward for investing before\nthe full Series A financing round comes together.\n\nIn this chapter, we cover the arguments for and against using\nconvertible debt. We then go through the terms in a convertible\ndebt deal, including the discount, valuation caps, interest rate, con-\nversion mechanics, conversion in a sale of the company, warrants,\nand other terms. We briefly cover the differences between early-stage\nand late-stage dynamics and finish up with an example of when con-\nvertible debt could be dangerous to use.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"107\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"108\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->",

It defines a convertible note as a loan that typically converts into preferred equity at the next qualifying financing, often at a discount to the new round price. The chapter walks through key commercial terms — discount, valuation cap, interest, maturity and automatic conversion triggers, qualified financing thresholds, amendment/consent mechanics, and the treatment of notes in an acquisition — and explains how each term affects dilution, timing, and control. It also covers less common add-ons such as warrants (including term length, merger treatment, and original issue discount accounting), and contrasts convertible notes with newer standardized instruments (SAFE, KISS), highlighting trade-offs (maturity and leverage, investor protections like pro rata, and simplicity). Finally, it distinguishes traditional bridge/late-stage notes from modern seed notes and flags scenarios where convertible debt can create serious risks (debt power, stalled conversion, misaligned incentives).",
