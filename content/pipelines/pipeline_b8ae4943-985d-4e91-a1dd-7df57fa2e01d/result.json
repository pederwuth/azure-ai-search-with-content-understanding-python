        "overall_summary": "This book presents a practical and conceptual framework for modeling page content as structured, machine-actionable objects. It begins by motivating why conventional document and web content often fails machine workflows—lack of consistent semantics, missing metadata, inaccessible visuals—and introduces the page-object abstraction as a way to encapsulate both the visible rendering and the underlying intent and data. Throughout, the book stresses that well-modeled page objects bridge human communication and automated processing: they preserve semantics for readers while enabling extraction, validation, and reuse by systems.\n\nA focused, early technical example— the Figure page object—shows how the idea works in detail. The book uses a concrete bar-chart example with embedded machine-readable metadata (title, chart type, topic keywords, detailed description, data table and axis titles) alongside rendered elements (figcaption, numeric values, month labels). This example crystallizes the approach: metadata expresses intent and semantics, the visible figure communicates to readers, and both are designed to be both accessible and machine-actionable. The chapter demonstrates practical techniques such as embedding summaries and data tables, labeling axes and captions for accessibility, and extracting the underlying numeric series for analytical interpretation (e.g., a January–June series [200, 300, 400, 450, 350, 250] that rises through April and then declines).\n\nBuilding on the Figure example, subsequent sections of the book broaden and deepen the pattern: other page-object types (tables, narratives, interactive components), conventions for metadata schemas, strategies for consistent rendering, and APIs and toolchains that produce, validate and consume page objects. The book ties these technical elements to real-world needs—automated reporting pipelines, accessible publishing, regulatory documentation, and repeatable analytics—showing how structured content reduces friction in business and finance contexts.\n\nBy the end, readers have a coherent set of principles, concrete patterns, and practical workflows. They can design page objects that make visualizations and documents both more usable for humans and more useful for machines, apply accessibility and documentation best practices, and implement data-extraction and validation processes that support robust analytics and automation.",
