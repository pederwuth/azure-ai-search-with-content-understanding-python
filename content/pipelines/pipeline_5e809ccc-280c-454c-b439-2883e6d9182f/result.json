The figure is described both visually and in metadata: it carries axis titles (Months and Values), a Markdown data table, and descriptive text that identifies April as the peak (450) and January as the trough (200). The chapter demonstrates how a figure can encapsulate raw numbers, axis labeling, and human-readable summary within the page-object model so that the same content can be consumed by readers and programmatic systems alike.\n\nThe chapter advances the reader’s practical understanding by showing how a single visual element consolidates data, annotation, and metadata. It highlights the month-to-month trend — a rise from January through April followed by a decline into June — and points out the importance of explicit axis titles and tabular backing for clear interpretation. Taken together, this material moves the reader from abstract concepts of page objects and visualization principles (from earlier chapters) to an applied example that supports business and finance analysis and automated content extraction.",
