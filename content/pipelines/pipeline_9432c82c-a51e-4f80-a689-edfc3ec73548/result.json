        "overall_summary": "Venture Deals demystifies the opaque language, incentives, and documents that govern venture capital financings and startup fundraising. The book opens by mapping the human and institutional players — entrepreneurs, angels, lead and follow-on VCs, syndicates, and lawyers — and explains how their differing incentives and authority shape the contours of every deal. From this foundation it defines the term sheet as the central negotiating vehicle and frames the negotiation around two core levers: economics (who owns what) and control (who makes the decisions).\n\nFrom there the authors walk readers clause by clause through typical term-sheet provisions: valuation and price mechanics, liquidation preferences and participation, option pool sizing, vesting and acceleration, antidilution protection, board composition and protective provisions, registration and information rights, and conversion triggers. Interwoven throughout are entrepreneur-focused sidebars that translate legal mechanics into pragmatic negotiating posture — what to fight over, what to accept, and how to create leverage in the fundraising process.\n\nThe book then moves to concrete, hands-on tools: cap table math with worked examples demonstrating pre-money vs. post-money effects and how a post-money option pool can materially dilute founders; an explanation of convertible debt instruments (notes, caps, discounts, SAFEs/KISS) and the traps and tradeoffs they create; and a short legal primer on employment, corporate form, and the critical 83(b) election entrepreneurs must not forget. Each technical chapter emphasizes transparency, clear documentation, and understanding the downstream consequences of seemingly small term-sheet choices.\n\nFinally, Venture Deals widens its lens to ecosystem dynamics, arguing that places that produce startups do so because of long-term, entrepreneur-led community building (the Boulder Thesis). Throughout, the book’s practical aim is constant: to give founders and new investors the vocabulary, mental models, and numeric skills to negotiate better, avoid common legal and financial pitfalls, and design financings that preserve upside while aligning incentives for follow-on growth and exit.",

It profiles the core participants — the entrepreneur who needs capital and control, the venture capitalist (VC) whose incentives are shaped by fund structure and limited partners, angel investors who often seed early-stage companies, syndicates that spread risk and expertise across investors, and the lawyers and mentors who guide both process and substance. The chapter explains financing-round nomenclature and types of VC firms so readers can distinguish between seed, early-stage, and later-stage players and understand why different investors bring different expectations about governance, dilution, and exit timing.\n\nBuilding on the Introduction’s framing of the \"art of the term sheet,\" this chapter shows that term-sheet economics and control provisions are driven as much by who is on the table as by legal form. It emphasizes practical dynamics — how a lead VC differs from passive syndicate members, why entrepreneurs should target the right type of firm, how angels can bridge the gap to institutional capital, and how counsel and mentors influence deal timing, diligence, and negotiation posture. By anchoring later technical chapters (on liquidation preferences, board composition, antidilution, etc.) in the real motivations and roles of these players, the chapter sets the stage for strategic fundraising and informed bargaining.",

            "chapter_title": "Foreword\n\nremember the first week of my career as a VC. I was 25 years\nold, it was 1986, and I had just landed a summer job in a venture\ncapital firm. I was working for three experienced venture capitalists\nin a small firm called Euclid Partners, where I ended up spending\nthe first 10 years of my VC career. One of those three partners,\nBliss McCrum, peeked his head into my office (I had an office in\nRockefeller Center at age 25) and said to me, \"Can you model out\na financing for XYZ Company at a $9 million pre-money, raising\n$3 million, with an unissued option pool of 10%?\" and then went\nback to the big office in the rear he shared with the other founding\npartner, Milton Pappas.\n\nI sat at my desk and started thinking about the request. I\nunderstood the \"raising $3 million\" bit. I thought I could figure\nout the \"unissued option pool of 10%\" bit. But what the hell was\n\"pre-money\"? I had never heard that term. This was almost a decade\nbefore Netscape and Internet search so searching online for it wasn't\nan option. After spending ten minutes getting up the courage, I\nwalked back to that big office, peeked my head in, and said to Bliss,\n\"Can you explain pre-money to me?\"\n\nThus began my 31-year education in venture capital that is still\ngoing on as I write this.\n\nThe venture capital business was a cottage industry back in 1985,\nwith club deals and a language all of its own. A cynic would say it was\ndesigned this way to be opaque to everyone other than the VCs so that\nthey would have all the leverage in negotiations with entrepreneurs.\nI don't entirely buy that narrative. I think the VC business grew up in\na few small offices in Boston, New York, and San Francisco, and the\ndozens-maybe as many as a hundred-of main participants, along\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"xiii\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"xiv Foreword\" -->\n\nwith their lawyers, came up with structures that made sense to them.\nThey then developed a shorthand so that they could communicate\namong themselves.\n\nBut whatever the origin story was, the language of venture deals\nis foreign to many and remains opaque and confusing to this day.\nThis works to the advantage of industry insiders and to the disadvan-\ntage of those who are new to startups and venture capital.\n\nIn the early 2000s, after I wound down my first venture capital\nfirm, Flatiron Partners, and before we started USV, I started blogging.\nOne of my goals with my AVC blog (at www.avc.com) was to bring\ntransparency to this opaque world that I had been inhabiting for\nalmost 20 years. I was joined in this blogging thing by Brad Feld, a\nfriend and frequent coinvestor. Club investing has not gone away\nand that's a good thing. By reading AVC and Feld Thoughts regu-\nlarly, an entrepreneur could get up to speed on startups and venture\ncapital. Brad and I received a tremendous amount of positive feed-\nback on our efforts to bring transparency to the venture capital busi-\nness so we kept doing it, and now if you search for something like\n\"participating preferred\" you will find posts written by both me and\nBrad on that first search results page.\n\nBrad and his partner Jason Mendelson (a recovering startup law-\nyer turned VC) took things a step further and wrote a book called\nVenture Deals back in 2011. It has turned into a classic and is now on\nits Third Edition. If Venture Deals had been around in 1985, I would\nnot have had to admit to Bliss that I had no idea what pre-money\nmeant.\n\nIf there is a guidebook to navigating the mysterious and confusing\nlanguage of venture capital and venture capital financing structures,\nit is Venture Deals. Anyone interested in startups, entrepreneurship,\nand angel and venture capital financings should do themselves a\nfavor and read it.\n\nFred Wilson\nUSV Partner\nJuly 2016\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->",
            "summary": "The Foreword and Preface set the tone for the rest of the book: venture capital is full of specialized language and opaque practices that can bewilder entrepreneurs new to the space. Fred Wilson’s Foreword underlines this with a personal anecdote about learning what “pre-money” meant and highlights the value of transparency — pointing readers to accessible resources (blogs and the book Venture Deals) that demystify deal language. The message is clear: understanding VC terminology and mechanics matters and is learnable.\n\nThe Preface explains why the authors wrote the book, tracing its origin to a popular Term Sheet blog series and an ongoing desire to create a practical, balanced guide for entrepreneurs and investors. It summarizes the book’s structure — from a history of the term sheet and profiles of participants, to practical guidance on how much to raise and what documents to prepare, deep dives into term-sheet economics, control and miscellaneous terms, convertible debt versus equity, a new section on crowdfunding, how VC firms operate (incentives and compensation), negotiation strategy, acquisition letters of intent, and common legal issues. The authors emphasize a balanced viewpoint (entrepreneur and VC), include sidebars with an entrepreneur’s perspective, and aim to make complex deal mechanics accessible and actionable.",

            "chapter_title": "Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet\n\n0\nne of the first famous venture capital investments was Digital\nEquipment Corporation (DEC). In 1957, American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation (AR&D), one of the first venture capital\nfirms, invested $70,000 in DEC. When DEC went public in 1968, this\ninvestment was worth over $355 million, or a return of over 5,000\ntimes the invested capital. AR&D's investment in DEC was one of the\noriginal venture capital home runs.\n\nIn 1957, the venture capital industry was just being created. At the\ntime, the investor community in the United States was uninterested\nin investing in computer companies, as the last wave of computer-\nrelated startups had performed poorly and even large companies\nwere having difficulty making money in the computer business. We\ncan envision the frustration of DEC's cofounders, Ken Olson and\nHarlan Anderson, as the investors they talked to rejected them\nand their fledgling idea for a business. We can also imagine their\njoy when Georges Doriot, the founder of American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation, offered to fund them. After a number\nof conversations and meetings, Doriot sent Olson and Anderson a\nletter expressing his interest in investing, along with his proposed\nterms. Today, this document is called the term sheet.\n\nNow, imagine what that term sheet looked like. There are three\ndifferent possibilities. The first is that it was a typed one-page let-\nter that said, \"We would like to invest $70,000 in your company\nand buy 78 percent of it.\" The next is that it was two pages of legal\nterms that basically said, \"We would like to invest $70,000 in your\ncompany and buy 78 percent of it.\" Or it could have been an eight-\npage typed document that had all kinds of protective provisions, vesting\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"1\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"2\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->\n\narrangements, drag-along rights, and Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission (SEC) registration rights.\n\nOur guess is that it was not the third option. Over the past 50\nyears, the art of the term sheet has evolved and expanded, reaching\nits current eight (or so) page literary masterpiece. These eight pages\ncontain a lot more than \"We'd like to invest $X in your company\nand get Y% of it,\" but, as you'll learn, there really are only two key\nthings that matter in the actual term sheet negotiation-economics\nand control.\n\nIn DEC's case, by owning 78% of the company, AR&D effec-\ntively had control of the company. And the price was clearly\ndefined-$70,000 bought 78% of the company, resulting in a $90,000\npost-money valuation.\n\nToday's venture capital investments have many more nuances.\nIndividual venture capitalists (VCs) usually end up owning less than\n50 percent of the company, so they don't have effective voting con-\ntrol but often negotiate provisions that give them control over major\ndecisions by the company. Many companies end up with multiple\nventure capitalists who invest in the company at different points in\ntime, resulting in different ownership percentages, varying rights,\nand diverging motivations. Founders don't always stay with the com-\npany through the exit and, in some cases, they end up leaving rela-\ntively early in the life of a company for a variety of reasons. Compa-\nnies fail, so venture capitalists have gotten much more focused on\nprotecting themselves for the downside as well as participating in the\nupside. Governance issues are always complex, especially when you\nhave a lot of people sitting around the negotiating table.\n\nWhile it would be desirable to do venture capital deals with a\nsimple agreement on price, a handshake, and a short legal agree-\nment, this rarely happens. And while there have been plenty of\nattempts to standardize the term sheet over the years, the prolifera-\ntion of lawyers, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs, along with a\nsteadily increasing number of investments, has prevented this from\nhappening. Ironically, the actual definitive documents have become\nmore standard over time. Whether it is the Internet age that has\nspread information across the ecosystem or clients growing tired of\npaying legal bills, there are more similarities in the documents today\nthan ever before. As a result, we can lend you our experience in how\nventure financings are usually done. The good news is once you've\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"3\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet\" -->\n\nnegotiated the term sheet, you are done with the hard part. As a\nresult, that's where we are going to focus our energy in this book.\n\nThroughout this book we will cover not only the what and the\nhow, but also the why things work as they do.

            "summary": "This chapter serves as an introduction to the art of the term sheet by framing why the term sheet matters and by mapping the players and mechanics that shape every venture financing. Building on the book’s opening discussions about terminology and opaque practices, it shows that while term sheets have become longer and more detailed over time, the real negotiation centers on two core axes: economics (who owns what) and control (who makes the decisions). The chapter then unpacks the human and institutional cast—VC hierarchy (MD/GP, partners, principals, associates, analysts, venture/operating partners, EIRs), angels/super angels/micro-VCs, syndicates and lead investors, and lawyers—and explains how their incentives, authority, and behavior affect every stage of a deal.\n\nThe second half of the chapter shifts to practical fundraising mechanics that entrepreneurs must master: round nomenclature (Pre-seed, Seed, Series A/B/C, numeric extensions), what materials matter (executive summary, pitch deck, demos over PPMs), how VCs evaluate opportunities (due diligence, partner involvement), and how to create leverage by synchronizing multiple interests and timelines. Emphases include choosing an experienced VC-savvy lawyer, focusing on the demo and concise materials, understanding who in a firm actually has decision power, and treating fundraising as a strategic, time-consuming process where choice and timing create negotiating power.",

All of the participants were to\nblame, and ignorance of what really mattered in the negotiation\nkept things going much longer than was necessary. We talked about\nwhat to do and, at the risk of giving away super-top-secret venture\ncapital magic tricks, decided to write a blog series on Brad's blog\n(Feld Thoughts-www.feld.com) that deconstructed a venture capital\nterm sheet and explained each section.\n\nThat blog series was the inspiration for this book. The next few\nchapters cover the most frequently discussed terms in a venture capi-\ntal term sheet. Many venture capitalists (VCs) love to negotiate hard\non every term as though the health of their children depended on\nthem getting the terms just right. Sometimes this is inexperience on\nthe part of the VC; often, it's just a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe specific language that we refer to is from actual term sheets.\nIn addition to describing and explaining the specific terms, we give\nyou examples of what to focus on and implications from the perspec-\ntives of the company, VCs, and entrepreneurs.",
            "summary": "Chapter 5 moves from the framing and players introduced earlier (Foreword, Preface, and Chapter 4) into a practical, clause-by-clause overview of what actually matters in a venture term sheet. The authors distill VC priorities into two core lenses—economics and control—and then walk through the most common economic terms (price/valuation, liquidation preference and participation, pay-to-play, option pool and warrants, vesting and exercise periods, dividends, redemption rights, and antidilution mechanics) and the key control terms (board composition, protective provisions, conversion and automatic conversion thresholds). Each term is explained in plain language, with examples of how the provision affects distribution of proceeds, voting power, incentives, and downstream negotiations.\n\nThe chapter emphasizes negotiation priorities and entrepreneur-centered tactics: don’t focus only on headline valuation; prepare an option budget before the option-pool fight; understand how warrants or back-door mechanisms effectively lower valuation; negotiate the type and scope of antidilution (broad-based weighted average preferred to full ratchet); favor double-trigger acceleration for vesting; equalize automatic-conversion thresholds across series to avoid a veto by later investors; and watch the conditions precedent and binding clauses (legal fees, no-shop, governing law). Practical sidebars reinforce when a term is mostly theoretical versus when it will materially affect founder equity or company control, and they advise entrepreneurs where to spend negotiating energy.",

A VC who refuses to document core employment terms up front is a serious red flag. The authors emphasize that entrepreneurs should not be locked into exclusivity without clarity on the operative business and people terms that will govern the definitive agreements.\n\nThe chapter also cautions that term sheets sometimes carry odd or highly conditional language—“wacky conditions”—and it reminds founders that signing a term sheet is not the same as closing a deal. Building on the earlier—chapter 4’s mapping of players and mechanics and chapter 5’s clause-by-clause walkthrough of economics and control—this chapter translates technical knowledge into negotiation posture: demand clarity, watch for binding/no-shop traps, and treat any unusual conditions with skepticism. In short, understand which provisions are binding, insist on spelling out the deal points that matter to you before exclusivity kicks in, and recognize that a signed term sheet does not guarantee a completed financing.",

At the same time, the chapter recognizes founder instincts to protect proprietary details and recommends pairing routine information rights with tailored confidentiality protections so sensitive data does not leak or get misused.\n\nThe chapter places these recommendations in practical terms: information rights are not just an administrative burden but a signal of professionalism and a foundation for a productive investor-founder relationship. Entrepreneurs should negotiate scope, frequency, and format so reporting is meaningful without being crushing, and insist on confidentiality clauses when particularly sensitive operational or strategic information is involved.

Rather than diving into registration rights minutiae, the chapter argues entrepreneurs should prioritize structuring the company and the deal to maximize eventual public market value — keeping optionality open for an IPO, aligning investor incentives toward a high‑value exit, and avoiding short‑term provisions that erode upside. Practical recommendations include managing dilution, preserving pro rata participation, planning for pre‑IPO housekeeping (cap table cleanliness, corporate governance), and understanding how lock‑ups, secondary sales, and conversion mechanics affect public market prospects.\n\nThe chapter connects tactical negotiation points to the strategic goal of going public: control and economic tradeoffs (the lenses from Chapter 5) must be weighed not only for today’s round but for the path to a successful IPO. It reiterates earlier advice about transparency and investor alignment (from Chapter 7) and founder protections during term-sheet negotiation (from Chapter 6), but reframes those as instruments to preserve upside.

It traces the historical shift—from an older orthodoxy that prevented founders from selling until investors could exit, to the modern reality of active secondaries and longer private-company lifecycles—and concludes that ROFRs help the company control its shareholder base and comply with heightened SEC scrutiny around private transfers.\n\nBuilding on earlier, clause-level discussions, the chapter gives practical entrepreneur-focused advice: don’t fight a ROFR wholesale, but make it precise. Define who qualifies as a \"major investor\" (so that minor or passive holders don’t gain blanket transfer control), and consider conditioning transferee rights on continued participation in subsequent financing rounds. These limits protect founders’ liquidity options while preserving the company’s ability to manage its cap table, align investor incentives, and keep downstream regulatory and governance issues manageable.",

            "chapter_title": "The Capitalization Table\n\nN.\now that we've worked through all of the specific clauses in the\nterm sheet, let's go through how a typical capitalization table (cap\ntable) works. A term sheet will almost always contain a summary\ncap table, which we describe in this chapter. You, your prospective\ninvestors, or occasionally your lawyers will generate a more detailed\ncap table.\n\nThe cap table summarizes who owns what part of the company\nbefore and after the financing. This is one area that some founders,\nespecially those who have not been exposed in the past to cap table\nmath, are often uncomfortable with. It's extremely important for\nfounders to understand exactly who owns what part of a company\nand what the implications are in a potential funding round.\n\nNormally when you initially set up the company, 100% will be\nallocated to the founders and employees, with a specific number of\nshares allocated to each individual. The question \"What will I own\nif a venture capitalist invests X in my company at a Y valuation?\" is\nrarely simple. To answer it, you need to be able to generate a cap\ntable to truly analyze the deal presented by a particular term sheet.\nFollowing is a model to work from with a typical example.\n\nLet's assume the following:\n\n2 million shares held by founders before the VC invests\n$10 million pre-money valuation\n$5 million investment by the VC\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"103\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"104\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->\n\nIn this example, the post-money valuation is $15 million ($10 mil-\nlion pre-money + $5 million investment). Consequently, the VCs\nown 33.33% of the company after the financing ($5 million invest-\nment/$15 million post-money valuation). This should be pretty\nstraightforward so far.\n\nNow, assume the term sheet includes a new employee option\npool of 20% on a post-money basis. Remember that this means that\nafter the financing, there will be an unallocated option pool equal\nto 20% of the company.\n\nAlthough the post-money valuation remains the same ($15 mil-\nlion), the requirement for a 20% option pool will have a significant\nimpact on the ownership of the founders. Per the cap table, you\ncan see how we calculate the percentage ownership for each class\nof owner, along with the price per share of the preferred stock. To\nstart, we've filled in the known numbers and now have to solve for\nthe unknowns (A, B, C, D, and E).\n\nFirst, let's solve for A, the founders' ownership percentage: A =\n100% minus the VC percentage minus the employee pool percent-\nage, or 100% - 33.33% - 20% = 46.67%. Given that we know that the\n2 million founders' shares represent 46.67% of the company, we can\ndetermine that the total shares outstanding (E = 2 million/ 0.4667)\nare 4,285,408. Now, if there are 4,285,408 shares outstanding, deter-\nmining the number of shares in the employee pool becomes B = E\n*0.20 or 857,081.\n\nThe same math applies for C, the number of shares of preferred\nstock the VCs have. C = E * 0.3333 or 1,428,326. Since $5 million\nbought 1,428,326 shares of preferred stock, then the price per share\nof preferred stock (D = $5 million/1,428,326) is $3.50 per share.\n\nFinally, always check your calculation. Since we know we have a\n$10 million pre-money valuation, then the shares prior to the financ-\ning (2 million founders' shares plus the 20% option pool) times the\nprice per share should equal $10 million. If you do this math, you'll\n\n\n<table>\n<caption>Example Capitalization Table</caption>\n<tr>\n<th>Class</th>\n<th>Shares</th>\n<th>Preferred Price</th>\n<th>Valuation</th>\n<th>Percentage</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Founders</td>\n<td>2,000,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Employee pool</td>\n<td>B</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Venture investors</td>\n<td>C</td>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>$5,000,000</td>\n<td>33.33%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>E</td>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>$15,000,000</td>\n<td>100%</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"105\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"The Capitalization Table\" -->\n\nsee that (2 million + 857,081) * $3.50 = $9,999,783.50. Oops, we are\noff by $216.50, which represents 62 shares (well, 61.857 shares).\n\nWhile this is close enough for an example, it's not close enough\nfor most VCs, or for most lawyers for that matter. And it shouldn't\nbe close enough for you. That's why most cap tables have two addi-\ntional significant digits (or fractional shares)-the rounding to the\nnearest share doesn't happen during intermediate steps but only at\nthe very end.\n\nAs the entrepreneur, you shouldn't blindly rely on legal counsel\nto generate these documents. There are a lot of good lawyers out\nthere with poor math skills, and the cap table can get messed up\nwhen left in the hands of the lawyers. Although some get it right, it's\nyour responsibility as the entrepreneur to make sure you understand\nyour cap table. This will be especially helpful at times when you want\nto expand the employee option pool and you are eloquent in front\nof your board of directors explaining the ramifications.",
            "summary": "Chapter 12 brings the term-sheet clause work into concrete numbers by explaining how a capitalization table (cap table) summarizes ownership before and after a financing. Building on the fact that a term sheet usually includes a summary cap table, the chapter walks through a simple, typical example: 2 million founder shares, a $10M pre‑money valuation, and a $5M VC investment. It explains pre‑money vs. post‑money math, shows how to solve for total shares outstanding, the number of option pool shares when the investor demands a 20% post‑money pool, and how to compute the VC preferred price per share. The example also highlights the practical need for fractional shares and extra precision so rounding does not materially misstate valuations or ownership percentages.\n\nThis chapter stresses that founders must understand and often build or check cap tables themselves — not blindly rely on lawyers — because cap tables affect negotiating posture (e.g., when arguing about size/timing of an option pool) and have direct implications for dilution, board dynamics, and the application of investor provisions discussed earlier. It emphasizes routine checks (for example verifying that pre‑money shares × price per share equals the pre‑money valuation) and shows how an apparently modest term (a post‑money option pool) can materially change founders’ ownership percentages.",

However, there is one\nother type of financing, often used at the seed stage, called a con-\nvertible debt financing. In fact, many angel investors will invest only\nwith this structure.\n\nConvertible debt is just that: debt. It's a loan. The loan will con-\nvert to equity (preferred stock, usually) at such time as another\nround is raised. The conversion usually includes some sort of dis-\ncount on the price to the future round.\n\nFor example, assume you raise $500,000 in convertible debt\nfrom angels with a 20% discount to the next round, and six months\nlater a venture capitalist (VC) offers to lead a Series A round of a\n$1 million investment at $1 a share. Your financing will actually be\nfor $1.5 million total, although the VCs will get 1 million Series A\nshares ($1 million at $1 per share) and the angels will get 625,000\nSeries A shares ($500,000 at $0.80 per share). The discount is appro-\npriate, as your early investors want some reward for investing before\nthe full Series A financing round comes together.\n\nIn this chapter, we cover the arguments for and against using\nconvertible debt. We then go through the terms in a convertible\ndebt deal, including the discount, valuation caps, interest rate, con-\nversion mechanics, conversion in a sale of the company, warrants,\nand other terms. We briefly cover the differences between early-stage\nand late-stage dynamics and finish up with an example of when con-\nvertible debt could be dangerous to use.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"107\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"108\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->",

The book opens by mapping the human and institutional players — entrepreneurs, angels, lead and follow-on VCs, syndicates, and lawyers — and explains how their differing incentives and authority shape the contours of every deal. From this foundation it defines the term sheet as the central negotiating vehicle and frames the negotiation around two core levers: economics (who owns what) and control (who makes the decisions).\n\nFrom there the authors walk readers clause by clause through typical term-sheet provisions: valuation and price mechanics, liquidation preferences and participation, option pool sizing, vesting and acceleration, antidilution protection, board composition and protective provisions, registration and information rights, and conversion triggers. Interwoven throughout are entrepreneur-focused sidebars that translate legal mechanics into pragmatic negotiating posture — what to fight over, what to accept, and how to create leverage in the fundraising process.\n\nThe book then moves to concrete, hands-on tools: cap table math with worked examples demonstrating pre-money vs. post-money effects and how a post-money option pool can materially dilute founders; an explanation of convertible debt instruments (notes, caps, discounts, SAFEs/KISS) and the traps and tradeoffs they create; and a short legal primer on employment, corporate form, and the critical 83(b) election entrepreneurs must not forget. Each technical chapter emphasizes transparency, clear documentation, and understanding the downstream consequences of seemingly small term-sheet choices.\n\nFinally, Venture Deals widens its lens to ecosystem dynamics, arguing that places that produce startups do so because of long-term, entrepreneur-led community building (the Boulder Thesis). Throughout, the book’s practical aim is constant: to give founders and new investors the vocabulary, mental models, and numeric skills to negotiate better, avoid common legal and financial pitfalls, and design financings that preserve upside while aligning incentives for follow-on growth and exit.",

          "chapter_title": "Foreword\n\nremember the first week of my career as a VC. I was 25 years\nold, it was 1986, and I had just landed a summer job in a venture\ncapital firm. I was working for three experienced venture capitalists\nin a small firm called Euclid Partners, where I ended up spending\nthe first 10 years of my VC career. One of those three partners,\nBliss McCrum, peeked his head into my office (I had an office in\nRockefeller Center at age 25) and said to me, \"Can you model out\na financing for XYZ Company at a $9 million pre-money, raising\n$3 million, with an unissued option pool of 10%?\" and then went\nback to the big office in the rear he shared with the other founding\npartner, Milton Pappas.\n\nI sat at my desk and started thinking about the request. I\nunderstood the \"raising $3 million\" bit. I thought I could figure\nout the \"unissued option pool of 10%\" bit. But what the hell was\n\"pre-money\"? I had never heard that term. This was almost a decade\nbefore Netscape and Internet search so searching online for it wasn't\nan option. After spending ten minutes getting up the courage, I\nwalked back to that big office, peeked my head in, and said to Bliss,\n\"Can you explain pre-money to me?\"\n\nThus began my 31-year education in venture capital that is still\ngoing on as I write this.\n\nThe venture capital business was a cottage industry back in 1985,\nwith club deals and a language all of its own. A cynic would say it was\ndesigned this way to be opaque to everyone other than the VCs so that\nthey would have all the leverage in negotiations with entrepreneurs.\nI don't entirely buy that narrative. I think the VC business grew up in\na few small offices in Boston, New York, and San Francisco, and the\ndozens-maybe as many as a hundred-of main participants, along\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"xiii\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"xiv Foreword\" -->\n\nwith their lawyers, came up with structures that made sense to them.\nThey then developed a shorthand so that they could communicate\namong themselves.\n\nBut whatever the origin story was, the language of venture deals\nis foreign to many and remains opaque and confusing to this day.\nThis works to the advantage of industry insiders and to the disadvan-\ntage of those who are new to startups and venture capital.\n\nIn the early 2000s, after I wound down my first venture capital\nfirm, Flatiron Partners, and before we started USV, I started blogging.\nOne of my goals with my AVC blog (at www.avc.com) was to bring\ntransparency to this opaque world that I had been inhabiting for\nalmost 20 years. I was joined in this blogging thing by Brad Feld, a\nfriend and frequent coinvestor. Club investing has not gone away\nand that's a good thing. By reading AVC and Feld Thoughts regu-\nlarly, an entrepreneur could get up to speed on startups and venture\ncapital. Brad and I received a tremendous amount of positive feed-\nback on our efforts to bring transparency to the venture capital busi-\nness so we kept doing it, and now if you search for something like\n\"participating preferred\" you will find posts written by both me and\nBrad on that first search results page.\n\nBrad and his partner Jason Mendelson (a recovering startup law-\nyer turned VC) took things a step further and wrote a book called\nVenture Deals back in 2011. It has turned into a classic and is now on\nits Third Edition. If Venture Deals had been around in 1985, I would\nnot have had to admit to Bliss that I had no idea what pre-money\nmeant.\n\nIf there is a guidebook to navigating the mysterious and confusing\nlanguage of venture capital and venture capital financing structures,\nit is Venture Deals. Anyone interested in startups, entrepreneurship,\nand angel and venture capital financings should do themselves a\nfavor and read it.\n\nFred Wilson\nUSV Partner\nJuly 2016\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->",
          "summary": "The Foreword and Preface set the tone for the rest of the book: venture capital is full of specialized language and opaque practices that can bewilder entrepreneurs new to the space. Fred Wilson’s Foreword underlines this with a personal anecdote about learning what “pre-money” meant and highlights the value of transparency — pointing readers to accessible resources (blogs and the book Venture Deals) that demystify deal language. The message is clear: understanding VC terminology and mechanics matters and is learnable.\n\nThe Preface explains why the authors wrote the book, tracing its origin to a popular Term Sheet blog series and an ongoing desire to create a practical, balanced guide for entrepreneurs and investors. It summarizes the book’s structure — from a history of the term sheet and profiles of participants, to practical guidance on how much to raise and what documents to prepare, deep dives into term-sheet economics, control and miscellaneous terms, convertible debt versus equity, a new section on crowdfunding, how VC firms operate (incentives and compensation), negotiation strategy, acquisition letters of intent, and common legal issues. The authors emphasize a balanced viewpoint (entrepreneur and VC), include sidebars with an entrepreneur’s perspective, and aim to make complex deal mechanics accessible and actionable.",

          "chapter_title": "Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet\n\n0\nne of the first famous venture capital investments was Digital\nEquipment Corporation (DEC). In 1957, American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation (AR&D), one of the first venture capital\nfirms, invested $70,000 in DEC. When DEC went public in 1968, this\ninvestment was worth over $355 million, or a return of over 5,000\ntimes the invested capital. AR&D's investment in DEC was one of the\noriginal venture capital home runs.\n\nIn 1957, the venture capital industry was just being created. At the\ntime, the investor community in the United States was uninterested\nin investing in computer companies, as the last wave of computer-\nrelated startups had performed poorly and even large companies\nwere having difficulty making money in the computer business. We\ncan envision the frustration of DEC's cofounders, Ken Olson and\nHarlan Anderson, as the investors they talked to rejected them\nand their fledgling idea for a business. We can also imagine their\njoy when Georges Doriot, the founder of American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation, offered to fund them. After a number\nof conversations and meetings, Doriot sent Olson and Anderson a\nletter expressing his interest in investing, along with his proposed\nterms. Today, this document is called the term sheet.\n\nNow, imagine what that term sheet looked like. There are three\ndifferent possibilities. The first is that it was a typed one-page let-\nter that said, \"We would like to invest $70,000 in your company\nand buy 78 percent of it.\" The next is that it was two pages of legal\nterms that basically said, \"We would like to invest $70,000 in your\ncompany and buy 78 percent of it.\" Or it could have been an eight-\npage typed document that had all kinds of protective provisions, vesting\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"1\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"2\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->\n\narrangements, drag-along rights, and Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission (SEC) registration rights.\n\nOur guess is that it was not the third option. Over the past 50\nyears, the art of the term sheet has evolved and expanded, reaching\nits current eight (or so) page literary masterpiece. These eight pages\ncontain a lot more than \"We'd like to invest $X in your company\nand get Y% of it,\" but, as you'll learn, there really are only two key\nthings that matter in the actual term sheet negotiation-economics\nand control.\n\nIn DEC's case, by owning 78% of the company, AR&D effec-\ntively had control of the company. And the price was clearly\ndefined-$70,000 bought 78% of the company, resulting in a $90,000\npost-money valuation.\n\nToday's venture capital investments have many more nuances.\nIndividual venture capitalists (VCs) usually end up owning less than\n50 percent of the company, so they don't have effective voting con-\ntrol but often negotiate provisions that give them control over major\ndecisions by the company. Many companies end up with multiple\nventure capitalists who invest in the company at different points in\ntime, resulting in different ownership percentages, varying rights,\nand diverging motivations. Founders don't always stay with the com-\npany through the exit and, in some cases, they end up leaving rela-\ntively early in the life of a company for a variety of reasons. Compa-\nnies fail, so venture capitalists have gotten much more focused on\nprotecting themselves for the downside as well as participating in the\nupside. Governance issues are always complex, especially when you\nhave a lot of people sitting around the negotiating table.\n\nWhile it would be desirable to do venture capital deals with a\nsimple agreement on price, a handshake, and a short legal agree-\nment, this rarely happens. And while there have been plenty of\nattempts to standardize the term sheet over the years, the prolifera-\ntion of lawyers, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs, along with a\nsteadily increasing number of investments, has prevented this from\nhappening. Ironically, the actual definitive documents have become\nmore standard over time. Whether it is the Internet age that has\nspread information across the ecosystem or clients growing tired of\npaying legal bills, there are more similarities in the documents today\nthan ever before. As a result, we can lend you our experience in how\nventure financings are usually done. The good news is once you've\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"3\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet\" -->\n\nnegotiated the term sheet, you are done with the hard part. As a\nresult, that's where we are going to focus our energy in this book.\n\nThroughout this book we will cover not only the what and the\nhow, but also the why things work as they do. Let's begin our explora-\ntion of venture capital financings by discussing the various players\ninvolved.\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer and Venture Capitalist, Third Edition By Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson Copyright @ 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\" -->",
          "summary": "This chapter serves as an introduction to the art of the term sheet by framing why the term sheet matters and by mapping the players and mechanics that shape every venture financing. Building on the book’s opening discussions about terminology and opaque practices, it shows that while term sheets have become longer and more detailed over time, the real negotiation centers on two core axes: economics (who owns what) and control (who makes the decisions). The chapter then unpacks the human and institutional cast—VC hierarchy (MD/GP, partners, principals, associates, analysts, venture/operating partners, EIRs), angels/super angels/micro-VCs, syndicates and lead investors, and lawyers—and explains how their incentives, authority, and behavior affect every stage of a deal.\n\nThe second half of the chapter shifts to practical fundraising mechanics that entrepreneurs must master: round nomenclature (Pre-seed, Seed, Series A/B/C, numeric extensions), what materials matter (executive summary, pitch deck, demos over PPMs), how VCs evaluate opportunities (due diligence, partner involvement), and how to create leverage by synchronizing multiple interests and timelines. Emphases include choosing an experienced VC-savvy lawyer, focusing on the demo and concise materials, understanding who in a firm actually has decision power, and treating fundraising as a strategic, time-consuming process where choice and timing create negotiating power.",

All of the participants were to\nblame, and ignorance of what really mattered in the negotiation\nkept things going much longer than was necessary. We talked about\nwhat to do and, at the risk of giving away super-top-secret venture\ncapital magic tricks, decided to write a blog series on Brad's blog\n(Feld Thoughts-www.feld.com) that deconstructed a venture capital\nterm sheet and explained each section.\n\nThat blog series was the inspiration for this book. The next few\nchapters cover the most frequently discussed terms in a venture capi-\ntal term sheet. Many venture capitalists (VCs) love to negotiate hard\non every term as though the health of their children depended on\nthem getting the terms just right. Sometimes this is inexperience on\nthe part of the VC; often, it's just a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe specific language that we refer to is from actual term sheets.\nIn addition to describing and explaining the specific terms, we give\nyou examples of what to focus on and implications from the perspec-\ntives of the company, VCs, and entrepreneurs.",

The authors distill VC priorities into two core lenses—economics and control—and then walk through the most common economic terms (price/valuation, liquidation preference and participation, pay-to-play, option pool and warrants, vesting and exercise periods, dividends, redemption rights, and antidilution mechanics) and the key control terms (board composition, protective provisions, conversion and automatic conversion thresholds). Each term is explained in plain language, with examples of how the provision affects distribution of proceeds, voting power, incentives, and downstream negotiations.\n\nThe chapter emphasizes negotiation priorities and entrepreneur-centered tactics: don’t focus only on headline valuation; prepare an option budget before the option-pool fight; understand how warrants or back-door mechanisms effectively lower valuation; negotiate the type and scope of antidilution (broad-based weighted average preferred to full ratchet); favor double-trigger acceleration for vesting; equalize automatic-conversion thresholds across series to avoid a veto by later investors; and watch the conditions precedent and binding clauses (legal fees, no-shop, governing law). Practical sidebars reinforce when a term is mostly theoretical versus when it will materially affect founder equity or company control, and they advise entrepreneurs where to spend negotiating energy.",

A VC who refuses to document core employment terms up front is a serious red flag. The authors emphasize that entrepreneurs should not be locked into exclusivity without clarity on the operative business and people terms that will govern the definitive agreements.\n\nThe chapter also cautions that term sheets sometimes carry odd or highly conditional language—“wacky conditions”—and it reminds founders that signing a term sheet is not the same as closing a deal. Building on the earlier—chapter 4’s mapping of players and mechanics and chapter 5’s clause-by-clause walkthrough of economics and control—this chapter translates technical knowledge into negotiation posture: demand clarity, watch for binding/no-shop traps, and treat any unusual conditions with skepticism. In short, understand which provisions are binding, insist on spelling out the deal points that matter to you before exclusivity kicks in, and recognize that a signed term sheet does not guarantee a completed financing.",

At the same time, the chapter recognizes founder instincts to protect proprietary details and recommends pairing routine information rights with tailored confidentiality protections so sensitive data does not leak or get misused.\n\nThe chapter places these recommendations in practical terms: information rights are not just an administrative burden but a signal of professionalism and a foundation for a productive investor-founder relationship. Entrepreneurs should negotiate scope, frequency, and format so reporting is meaningful without being crushing, and insist on confidentiality clauses when particularly sensitive operational or strategic information is involved.

Rather than diving into registration rights minutiae, the chapter argues entrepreneurs should prioritize structuring the company and the deal to maximize eventual public market value — keeping optionality open for an IPO, aligning investor incentives toward a high‑value exit, and avoiding short‑term provisions that erode upside. Practical recommendations include managing dilution, preserving pro rata participation, planning for pre‑IPO housekeeping (cap table cleanliness, corporate governance), and understanding how lock‑ups, secondary sales, and conversion mechanics affect public market prospects.\n\nThe chapter connects tactical negotiation points to the strategic goal of going public: control and economic tradeoffs (the lenses from Chapter 5) must be weighed not only for today’s round but for the path to a successful IPO. It reiterates earlier advice about transparency and investor alignment (from Chapter 7) and founder protections during term-sheet negotiation (from Chapter 6), but reframes those as instruments to preserve upside. The bottom line: registration rights are a backstop, not the main game — entrepreneurs should design financing and governance to keep the company attractive to public investors and to retain as much capture of future value as possible.",

          "summary": "Chapter 9 reframes the sale-restriction debate from the entrepreneur’s point of view, arguing that the restriction on sales (the right of first refusal on common stock, or ROFR on common) is generally constructive rather than punitive. The chapter defines the typical clause, recommends placing it in the bylaws for clarity and enforceability, and explains the common implementation practice of allowing the company to exercise the ROFR and then assign that right to investors. It traces the historical shift—from an older orthodoxy that prevented founders from selling until investors could exit, to the modern reality of active secondaries and longer private-company lifecycles—and concludes that ROFRs help the company control its shareholder base and comply with heightened SEC scrutiny around private transfers.\n\nBuilding on earlier, clause-level discussions, the chapter gives practical entrepreneur-focused advice: don’t fight a ROFR wholesale, but make it precise. Define who qualifies as a \"major investor\" (so that minor or passive holders don’t gain blanket transfer control), and consider conditioning transferee rights on continued participation in subsequent financing rounds. These limits protect founders’ liquidity options while preserving the company’s ability to manage its cap table, align investor incentives, and keep downstream regulatory and governance issues manageable.",

          "chapter_title": "The Capitalization Table\n\nN.\now that we've worked through all of the specific clauses in the\nterm sheet, let's go through how a typical capitalization table (cap\ntable) works. A term sheet will almost always contain a summary\ncap table, which we describe in this chapter. You, your prospective\ninvestors, or occasionally your lawyers will generate a more detailed\ncap table.\n\nThe cap table summarizes who owns what part of the company\nbefore and after the financing. This is one area that some founders,\nespecially those who have not been exposed in the past to cap table\nmath, are often uncomfortable with. It's extremely important for\nfounders to understand exactly who owns what part of a company\nand what the implications are in a potential funding round.\n\nNormally when you initially set up the company, 100% will be\nallocated to the founders and employees, with a specific number of\nshares allocated to each individual. The question \"What will I own\nif a venture capitalist invests X in my company at a Y valuation?\" is\nrarely simple. To answer it, you need to be able to generate a cap\ntable to truly analyze the deal presented by a particular term sheet.\nFollowing is a model to work from with a typical example.\n\nLet's assume the following:\n\n2 million shares held by founders before the VC invests\n$10 million pre-money valuation\n$5 million investment by the VC\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"103\" -->\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"104\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Venture Deals\" -->\n\nIn this example, the post-money valuation is $15 million ($10 mil-\nlion pre-money + $5 million investment). Consequently, the VCs\nown 33.33% of the company after the financing ($5 million invest-\nment/$15 million post-money valuation). This should be pretty\nstraightforward so far.\n\nNow, assume the term sheet includes a new employee option\npool of 20% on a post-money basis. Remember that this means that\nafter the financing, there will be an unallocated option pool equal\nto 20% of the company.\n\nAlthough the post-money valuation remains the same ($15 mil-\nlion), the requirement for a 20% option pool will have a significant\nimpact on the ownership of the founders. Per the cap table, you\ncan see how we calculate the percentage ownership for each class\nof owner, along with the price per share of the preferred stock. To\nstart, we've filled in the known numbers and now have to solve for\nthe unknowns (A, B, C, D, and E).\n\nFirst, let's solve for A, the founders' ownership percentage: A =\n100% minus the VC percentage minus the employee pool percent-\nage, or 100% - 33.33% - 20% = 46.67%. Given that we know that the\n2 million founders' shares represent 46.67% of the company, we can\ndetermine that the total shares outstanding (E = 2 million/ 0.4667)\nare 4,285,408. Now, if there are 4,285,408 shares outstanding, deter-\nmining the number of shares in the employee pool becomes B = E\n*0.20 or 857,081.\n\nThe same math applies for C, the number of shares of preferred\nstock the VCs have. C = E * 0.3333 or 1,428,326. Since $5 million\nbought 1,428,326 shares of preferred stock, then the price per share\nof preferred stock (D = $5 million/1,428,326) is $3.50 per share.\n\nFinally, always check your calculation. Since we know we have a\n$10 million pre-money valuation, then the shares prior to the financ-\ning (2 million founders' shares plus the 20% option pool) times the\nprice per share should equal $10 million. If you do this math, you'll\n\n\n<table>\n<caption>Example Capitalization Table</caption>\n<tr>\n<th>Class</th>\n<th>Shares</th>\n<th>Preferred Price</th>\n<th>Valuation</th>\n<th>Percentage</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Founders</td>\n<td>2,000,000</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Employee pool</td>\n<td>B</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Venture investors</td>\n<td>C</td>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>$5,000,000</td>\n<td>33.33%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>E</td>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>$15,000,000</td>\n<td>100%</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"www.itdf.ir\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"105\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"The Capitalization Table\" -->\n\nsee that (2 million + 857,081) * $3.50 = $9,999,783.50. Oops, we are\noff by $216.50, which represents 62 shares (well, 61.857 shares).\n\nWhile this is close enough for an example, it's not close enough\nfor most VCs, or for most lawyers for that matter. And it shouldn't\nbe close enough for you. That's why most cap tables have two addi-\ntional significant digits (or fractional shares)-the rounding to the\nnearest share doesn't happen during intermediate steps but only at\nthe very end.\n\nAs the entrepreneur, you shouldn't blindly rely on legal counsel\nto generate these documents. There are a lot of good lawyers out\nthere with poor math skills, and the cap table can get messed up\nwhen left in the hands of the lawyers. Although some get it right, it's\nyour responsibility as the entrepreneur to make sure you understand\nyour cap table. This will be especially helpful at times when you want\nto expand the employee option pool and you are eloquent in front\nof your board of directors explaining the ramifications.",
          "summary": "Chapter 12 brings the term-sheet clause work into concrete numbers by explaining how a capitalization table (cap table) summarizes ownership before and after a financing. Building on the fact that a term sheet usually includes a summary cap table, the chapter walks through a simple, typical example: 2 million founder shares, a $10M pre‑money valuation, and a $5M VC investment. It explains pre‑money vs. post‑money math, shows how to solve for total shares outstanding, the number of option pool shares when the investor demands a 20% post‑money pool, and how to compute the VC preferred price per share. The example also highlights the practical need for fractional shares and extra precision so rounding does not materially misstate valuations or ownership percentages.\n\nThis chapter stresses that founders must understand and often build or check cap tables themselves — not blindly rely on lawyers — because cap tables affect negotiating posture (e.g., when arguing about size/timing of an option pool) and have direct implications for dilution, board dynamics, and the application of investor provisions discussed earlier. It emphasizes routine checks (for example verifying that pre‑money shares × price per share equals the pre‑money valuation) and shows how an apparently modest term (a post‑money option pool) can materially change founders’ ownership percentages.",

However, there is one\nother type of financing, often used at the seed stage, called a con-\nvertible debt financing. In fact, many angel investors will invest only\nwith this structure.\n\nConvertible debt is just that: debt. It's a loan. The loan will con-\nvert to equity (preferred stock, usually) at such time as another\nround is raised. The conversion usually includes some sort of dis-\ncount on the price to the future round.\n\nFor example, assume you raise $500,000 in convertible debt\nfrom angels with a 20% discount to the next round, and six months\nlater a venture capitalist (VC) offers to lead a Series A round of a\n$1 million investment at $1 a share. Your financing will actually be\nfor $1.5 million total, although the VCs will get 1 million Series A\nshares ($1 million at $1 per share) and the angels will get 625,000\nSeries A shares ($500,000 at $0.80 per share). The discount is appro-\npriate, as your early investors want some reward for investing before\nthe full Series A financing round comes together.\n\nIn this chapter, we cover the arguments for and against using\nconvertible debt. We then go through the terms in a convertible\ndebt deal, including the discount, valuation caps, interest rate, con-\nversion mechanics, conversion in a sale of the company, warrants,\nand other terms.
