It begins by establishing the Page Object pattern as a way to model the logical structure of a page — its components, responsibilities and interfaces — and then progressively applies that pattern to increasingly rich and semantically important components such as forms, tables, and, centrally, figures. The concrete bar-chart example (monthly values January–June with a peak in April at 450 and a trough in January at 200) recurs as an illustrative case: the figure is shown to carry both visual cues and an embedded metadata block that makes its data and intent explicit and extractable.",
