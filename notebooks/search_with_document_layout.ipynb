    "# Retrieval Augmented Generation with Content Understanding\n",

    "This notebook presents a guideline on how to leverage the Azure AI Content Understanding for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in document files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leveraging Azure AI's Content Understanding Layout analysis, it extracts tables, paragraphs, and layout information from PDF files. The resulting markdown output can be utilized with LangChain's markdown header splitter, facilitating semantic chunking of documents. These chunked documents are then indexed into the Azure AI Search vector store. When a user query is received, Azure AI Search retrieves the relevant chunks, which are subsequently used to generate a context-aware response."
