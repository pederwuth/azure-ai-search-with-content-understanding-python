    "# Visual Document Search with Azure Content Understanding\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This document illustrates an example workflow for how to leverage the Azure AI Content Understanding API to enhance the quality of document search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample will demonstrate the following steps:\n",
    "1. Extract the layout and content of a document using Azure AI Document Intelligence.\n",
    "2. For each figure in the document, extract its content with a custom analyzer using Azure AI Content Understanding, and insert it into the corresponding location in the document content.\n",
    "2. Chunk and embed the document content with LangChain and Azure OpenAI, and index them with Azure Search to generate an Azure Search index.\n",
    "3. Utilize an OpenAI chat model to search through content in the document with a natural language query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "1. Follow the [README](../README.md#configure-azure-ai-service-resource) to create the required resources for this sample.\n",
    "1. Install the required packages."

      "**DetailedDescription**: The image contains four charts related to immigrants and natives in the United States. The first chart is a histogram showing the age distribution of natives and previous immigrants compared to recent immigrants. Natives and previous immigrants have a more evenly distributed age range, while recent immigrants are concentrated in the younger age brackets. The second chart is a bar chart showing the distribution of educational attainment among natives and immigrants. Natives have a higher percentage of individuals with some high school and college education, while immigrants have a higher percentage with no schooling. The third chart is a horizontal bar chart showing the distribution of new immigrants across various industries, with construction being the most common industry, followed by manufacturing and administrative support. The fourth chart is a box plot showing wage income distribution among natives, immigrants before 2000, and recent immigrants. Natives have the highest median wage income, followed by immigrants before 2000, with recent immigrants having the lowest median wage income.\n",
      "**Summary**: The charts provide insights into the demographics, education, industry distribution, and wage income of immigrants compared to natives in the U.S. Recent immigrants tend to be younger, have lower educational attainment, are concentrated in specific industries like construction, and have lower wage incomes compared to natives and previous immigrants.\n",

      "**DetailedDescription**: The chart displays the 10-year Treasury term premia from 2018 to 2024, measured in percent. It includes three different term premia estimates: ACM, CR, and DKW. The ACM line fluctuates between -2% and 1%, showing significant volatility, especially around 2020 and 2023. The CR line is generally higher than ACM, ranging from -1% to 1%, with peaks around 2021 and 2023. The DKW line is the most stable, hovering around 0% throughout the period, with slight increases and decreases but less volatility compared to ACM and CR.\n",

The left histogram shows the distribution of Tier 1 Capital Ratios under CRE Stress, while the right histogram shows the distribution under CRE Stress combined with an Uninsured Deposit Run. Both histograms have a minimum requirement line at 6%. The x-axis represents the Tier 1 Capital Ratio in percent, ranging from -20 to 80, while the y-axis represents frequency, ranging from 0 to 500. The data is categorized by bank size: less than $1 billion, $1 billion to $10 billion, $10 billion to $100 billion, and more than $100 billion. The left histogram shows a concentration of banks around the 6% requirement, with a few banks having ratios below 0%. The right histogram shows a similar distribution but with a wider spread, indicating more banks with lower ratios under the combined stress scenario.\n",

The projections are based on different assumptions: medium-term extrapolation, medium-term extrapolation with debt stabilizing primary balance, and historical average assumptions. The risk indication is shown with color codes: red for high risk and green for low risk. The GFNs-to-GDP ratio is projected to decrease from 2016 to 2029 and then stabilize, while the total public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase steadily over the same period. The projections include baseline, baseline with T+5 and DSPB, and custom scenarios. The commentary notes that the long-term amortization module does not trigger an overall risk indication, and long-term projections show a steady increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio and GFNs-to-GDP ratio.\n",

The GFN-to-GDP ratio chart shows three lines: Baseline: Custom, Health (Demographics), and Health (Demographics + ECG). The Baseline: Custom line starts at around 30% in 2016, peaks at about 75% in 2022, and then stabilizes around 40% by 2052. The Health (Demographics) line follows a similar trend but ends slightly higher at around 45% in 2052. The Health (Demographics + ECG) line ends even higher at about 50% in 2052. The Total Public Debt-to-GDP ratio chart also shows three lines with similar labels. The Baseline: Custom line starts at about 100% in 2016, increases to around 125% by 2022, and then gradually rises to about 200% by 2052. The Health (Demographics) line ends slightly higher at around 210% in 2052, while the Health (Demographics + ECG) line ends at about 225% in 2052.\n",
