    "# Visual Document Search with Azure Content Understanding\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This document illustrates an example workflow for how to leverage the Azure AI Content Understanding API to enhance the quality of document search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample will demonstrate the following steps:\n",
    "1. Extract the layout and content of a document using Azure AI Document Intelligence.\n",
    "2. For each figure in the document, extract its content with a custom analyzer using Azure AI Content Understanding, and insert it into the corresponding location in the document content.\n",
    "2. Chunk and embed the document content with LangChain and Azure OpenAI, and index them with Azure Search to generate an Azure Search index.\n",
    "3. Utilize an OpenAI chat model to search through content in the document with a natural language query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "1. Follow the [README](../README.md#configure-azure-ai-service-resource) to create the required resources for this sample.\n",
    "1. Install the required packages."

      "**DetailedDescription**: The image contains four charts related to immigrants and natives in the United States. The first chart is a histogram showing the age distribution of natives and previous immigrants compared to recent immigrants. Natives and previous immigrants have a more even distribution across ages, while recent immigrants are concentrated in the younger age groups. The second chart is a bar chart showing the distribution of educational attainment among natives and immigrants. Natives have higher percentages in 'Some high-school' and 'College' categories, while immigrants have a higher percentage in 'No schooling'. The third chart is a horizontal bar chart showing the distribution of new immigrants across various industries, with the highest percentage in Construction, followed by Manufacturing and Admin & Support. The fourth chart is a box plot showing wage income distribution among natives, immigrants before 2000, and recent immigrants, with natives having the highest median income and recent immigrants the lowest.\n",
      "**Summary**: The charts provide insights into the demographics, education, industry distribution, and wage income of immigrants compared to natives in the U.S. Recent immigrants tend to be younger, have lower educational attainment, are concentrated in specific industries like construction, and have lower wage incomes compared to natives.\n",

      "**DetailedDescription**: The chart titled 'Estimated Reserve Demand Curve' shows the relationship between the excess reserves plus overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRP) as a percentage of GDP and the difference between the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and the interest on reserve balances (IORB). The x-axis represents the excess reserves plus ON RRP as a percentage of GDP, ranging from 0 to 25. The y-axis shows the difference between EFFR and IORB, ranging from -0.3 to 0.2 percent. The chart includes observations from three periods: 2009-2012, 2013-2019, and 2020-2024, represented by different colored dots (gray, black, and red respectively). The curve shows a downward trend, indicating that as excess reserves increase, the difference between EFFR and IORB decreases.\n",
      "**Summary**: The 'Estimated Reserve Demand Curve' illustrates how the difference between the effective federal funds rate and the interest on reserve balances changes with varying levels of excess reserves as a percentage of GDP. The curve suggests that higher excess reserves are associated with a smaller difference between EFFR and IORB, with data points from 2009 to 2024 showing this trend.\n",

The ACM model shows significant fluctuations, starting above 0% in 2018, dipping below -1% in 2020, and rising again to around 0% by 2024. The CR model follows a similar pattern but remains mostly above the ACM line, peaking above 1% in 2023.

Both histograms have a minimum requirement line at 6%. The x-axis represents the Tier 1 Capital Ratio in percent, ranging from -20 to 80, while the y-axis represents frequency, ranging from 0 to 500. The data is categorized by bank size: less than $1 billion, $1 billion to $10 billion, $10 billion to $100 billion, and more than $100 billion. The left histogram shows a concentration of banks with Tier 1 Capital Ratios around 10%, with fewer banks having ratios below 6%.

The risk indication is shown with color codes: red for high risk and green for low risk. The GFNs-to-GDP ratio is projected to decrease from 2016 to 2029 and then stabilize, while the total public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase steadily over the same period. The projections include baseline, baseline with T+5 and DSPB, and custom scenarios.

      "**DetailedDescription**: The figure consists of two line charts showing projections for the United States' GFN-to-GDP ratio and Total Public Debt-to-GDP ratio from 2016 to 2052. The GFN-to-GDP ratio chart shows three lines: Baseline: Custom, Health (Demographics), and Health (Demographics + ECG). The Baseline: Custom line starts at around 30% in 2016, peaks at about 75% in 2022, and then stabilizes around 40% by 2052. The Health (Demographics) line follows a similar trend but ends slightly higher at around 45% in 2052. The Health (Demographics + ECG) line ends even higher at approximately 52% in 2052. The Total Public Debt-to-GDP ratio chart also shows three lines with similar labels. The Baseline: Custom line starts at about 100% in 2016, increases to around 125% by 2022, and then gradually rises to about 200% by 2052. The Health (Demographics) line ends slightly higher at around 210% in 2052, while the Health (Demographics + ECG) line ends at approximately 225% in 2052.\n",
