    "This document illustrates an example workflow for how to leverage the Azure AI Content Understanding API to enhance the quality of document search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample will demonstrate the following steps:\n",
    "1. Extract the layout and content of a document using Azure AI Document Intelligence.\n",
    "2. For each figure in the document, extract its content with a custom analyzer using Azure AI Content Understanding, and insert it into the corresponding location in the document content.\n",
    "2. Chunk and embed the document content with LangChain and Azure OpenAI, and index them with Azure Search to generate an Azure Search index.\n",
    "3. Utilize an OpenAI chat model to search through content in the document with a natural language query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "1. Follow the [README](../README.md#configure-azure-ai-service-resource) to create the required resources for this sample.\n",
    "1. Install the required packages."

Crude oil production, measured in million barrels per day, is shown on the left y-axis, while natural gas production, measured in billion cubic feet per day, is shown on the right y-axis. Crude oil production started at around 9 million barrels per day in 2015 and saw fluctuations, with a significant increase starting in 2018, peaking at over 13 million barrels per day in 2020, followed by a decline and then a recovery to similar levels by 2024. Natural gas production started at around 80 billion cubic feet per day in 2015, steadily increased to over 120 billion cubic feet per day by 2024, with minor fluctuations.\n",
      "**Summary**: The chart illustrates the trends in U.S. energy production, highlighting a general increase in both crude oil and natural gas production over the years. Crude oil production experienced a peak in 2020, followed by a decline and recovery, while natural gas production showed a steady upward trend throughout the period.\n",
